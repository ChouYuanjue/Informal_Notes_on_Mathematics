§7.7 Homotopy and simply connected spaces

Prototypical example for this section: $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$.

Now let's motivate the idea of homotopy. Consider the example of the complex plane C (which you can think of just as R²) with two points p and q. There's a whole bunch of paths from p to q but somehow they're not very different from one another. If I told you "walk from p to q" you wouldn't have too many questions.

图像显示了一个浅蓝色背景的矩形区域，右上角标有字母“C”。区域内有两个黑点，分别标记为“p”和“q”。点“p”位于左侧，点“q”位于右侧，两者大致处于同一水平线上。

从点“p”到点“q”有三条不同颜色的路径：
1. 一条红色的曲线路径，从“p”开始向上弯曲，达到一个最高点后向下弯曲，最终到达“q”。这条曲线在“p”和“q”之间形成一个拱形。
2. 一条绿色的直线路径，从“p”水平延伸到“q”。这条路径上有一个箭头指向“q”。
3. 一条蓝色的折线路径，从“p”开始向下倾斜，然后水平延伸一段距离，再向上倾斜，最终到达“q”。这条路径上也有一个箭头指向“q”。

所有三条路径都连接了点“p”和点“q”。

So we're living happily in C until a meteor strikes the origin, blowing it out of existence. Then suddenly to get from p to q, people might tell you two different things: "go left around the meteor" or "go right around the meteor".

图像展示了一个浅紫色背景的矩形区域，代表复平面 $\mathbb{C}$。在右上角，标注了 $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$，表示这个区域是复平面去除原点（0）后的部分。

区域中央有一个灰色的实心圆，代表一个被移除的点或区域，即原点。

在矩形区域内，有两个标记点：左侧的 $p$ 和右侧的 $q$。

从点 $p$ 到点 $q$ 有两条路径：
1. 一条红色的曲线路径，位于灰色圆的上方，呈波浪形。
2. 一条蓝色的折线路径，位于灰色圆的下方，由三段直线组成。

两条路径都避开了灰色的圆。

So what's happening? In the first picture, the red, green, and blue paths somehow all looked the same: if you imagine them as pieces of elastic string pinned down at p and q, you can stretch each one to any other one.

But in the second picture, you can't move the red string to match with the blue string:
there's a meteor in the way. The paths are actually different.³

The formal notion we'll use to capture this is homotopy equivalence. We want to write a definition such that in the first picture, the three paths are all homotopic, but the two paths in the second picture are somehow not homotopic. And the idea is just continuous deformation.

Definition 7.7.1. Let α and β be paths in X whose endpoints coincide. A (path) homotopy from α to β is a continuous function F : [0, 1]² → X, which we'll write F_s(t) for s, t ∈ [0, 1], such that

and moreover

homotopy exists, we say α and β are path homotopic and write α ~ β.

What this definition is doing is taking $\alpha$ and "continuously deforming" it to $\beta$, while keeping the endpoints fixed. Note that for each particular $s$, $F_s$ is itself a function. So $s$ represents time as we deform $\alpha$ to $\beta$: it goes from 0 to 1, starting at $\alpha$ and ending at $\beta$.

图像包含两个并排的图表。

左侧图表在一个浅蓝色背景的矩形区域内，展示了从点p到点q的五条曲线。点p和点q是两个黑色的圆点。这五条曲线颜色从绿色渐变到蓝色，并分别标记为：
- 最上方的绿色曲线标记为 $F_0 = \alpha$
- 第二条绿色曲线标记为 $F_{0.25}$
- 中间的浅蓝色曲线标记为 $F_{0.5}$
- 第四条蓝色曲线标记为 $F_{0.75}$
- 最下方的蓝色曲线标记为 $F_1 = \beta$
这些曲线都从点p开始，到点q结束。

右侧图表标记为C，在一个白色背景的区域内，展示了一条实线曲线和两条虚线曲线。所有曲线都是蓝色的。
- 一条实线曲线从左侧的一个黑点开始，向右上方弯曲，然后向右下方弯曲，最终到达右侧的一个黑点。
- 一条虚线曲线从左侧的黑点开始，向左下方弯曲，然后向上弯曲，再向右上方弯曲，最终与实线曲线在右侧的黑点汇合。
- 另一条虚线曲线从左侧的黑点开始，向左上方弯曲，然后向下弯曲，再向右下方弯曲，最终与实线曲线在右侧的黑点汇合。
这两个黑点与左侧图表中的p和q位置相似。

So now I can tell you what makes C special:

Definition 7.7.4. A space X is simply connected if it's path-connected and for any points p and q, all paths from p to q are homotopic.

That's why you don't ask questions when walking from p to q in C: there's really only one way to walk. Hence the term "simply" connected.

Definition 1.1. A semigroup is a nonempty set G together with a binary operation on G which is

A monoid is a semigroup G which contains a

(ii) (two-sided) identity element e ∈ G such that ae = ea = a for all a ∈ G.

A group is a monoid G such that

(iii) for every a ∈ G there exists a (two-sided) inverse element a⁻¹ ∈ G such that
a⁻¹a = aa⁻¹ = e.

A semigroup G is said to be abelian or commutative if its binary operation is

A group G is said to be abelian or commutative if its binary operation is

(iv) commutative: ab = ba for all a,b ∈ G.

Our principal interest is in groups. However, semigroups and monoids are convenient for stating certain theorems in the greatest generality. Examples are given below. The order of a group G is the cardinal number |G|. G is said to be finite [resp. infinite] if |G| is finite [resp. infinite].

时隔两年来看 Hungerford，怀旧。

Proposition 1.3. Let G be a semigroup. Then G is a group if and only if the following conditions hold:

(i) there exists an element e ∈ G such that ea = a for all a ∈ G (left identity element);
(ii) for each a ∈ G, there exists an element a⁻¹ ∈ G such that a⁻¹a = e (left inverse).

Proposition 1.4. Let G be a semigroup. Then G is a group if and only if for all a, b ∈ G the equations ax = b and ya = b have solutions in G.

a·e = a
e: a(a⁻¹a) = (a·a⁻¹)a = ea = a
e is two-sided.
∴ G is a group.

EXAMPLES. The integers Z, the rational numbers Q, and the real numbers R are each infinite abelian groups under ordinary addition. Each is a monoid under ordinary multiplication, but not a group (0 has no inverse). However, the nonzero elements of Q and R respectively form infinite abelian groups under multiplication. The even integers under multiplication form a semigroup that is not a monoid.

EXAMPLE. Consider the square with vertices consecutively numbered 1,2,3,4, center at the origin of the x-y plane, and sides parallel to the axes.

图像显示了一个二维笛卡尔坐标系，包含水平的x轴和垂直的y轴，它们在原点相交。一个正方形被放置在坐标系中，其中心位于原点。正方形的四条边分别与x轴和y轴平行。正方形被x轴和y轴分成四个象限，每个象限内都标有一个数字。左上方的象限标有数字“1”，右上方的象限标有数字“2”，右下方的象限标有数字“3”，左下方的象限标有数字“4”。

Let $D_4^*$ be the following set of "transformations" of the square. $D_4^* = \{R, R^2, R^3, I, T_x, T_y, T_{1,3}, T_{2,4}\}$, where $R$ is a counterclockwise rotation about the center of $90^\circ$, $R^2$ a counterclockwise rotation of $180^\circ$, $R^3$ a counterclockwise rotation of $270^\circ$.

EXAMPLE. Let S be a nonempty set and A(S) the set of all bijections S → S. Under the operation of composition of functions, f o g, A(S) is a group, since composition is associative, composition of bijections is a bijection, 1s is a bijection, and every bijection has an inverse (see (13) of Introduction, Section 3). The elements of A(S) are called permutations and A(S) is called the group of permutations on the set S. If S = {1,2,3,..., n}, then A(S) is called the symmetric group on n letters and denoted Sn. Verify that |Sn| = n! (Exercise 5). The groups Sn play an important role in the theory of finite groups.

Since an element $\sigma$ of $S_n$ is a function on the finite set $S = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, it can be described by listing the elements of $S$ on a line and the image of each element under $\sigma$ directly below it:
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & \dots & n \\ i_1 & i_2 & i_3 & \dots & i_n \end{pmatrix} $$
The product $\sigma\tau$ of two elements of $S_n$ is the composition function $\tau$ followed by $\sigma$; that is, the function on $S$ given by $k \mapsto \sigma(\tau(k))$.

For instance, let $\sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\tau = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$ be elements of $S_4$. Then under $\sigma\tau$, $1 \mapsto \sigma(\tau(1)) = \sigma(4) = 4$, etc.; thus
$$ \sigma\tau = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 4 & 3 & 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} $$
similarly,
$$ \tau\sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 \end{pmatrix} $$
This example also shows that $S_n$ need not be abelian.

Theorem 1.5. Let R (~) be an equivalence relation on a monoid G such that a₁ ~ a₂ and b₁ ~ b₂ imply a₁b₁ ~ a₂b₂ for all aᵢ,bᵢ ∈ G. Then the set G/R of all equivalence classes of G under R is a monoid under the binary operation defined by (ā)(b̄) = āb̄, where x̄ denotes the equivalence class of x ∈ G. If G is an [abelian] group, then so is G/R.

An equivalence relation on a monoid G that satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem is called a congruence relation on G.

2. HOMOMORPHISMS AND SUBGROUPS

Essential to the study of any class of algebraic objects are the functions that preserve the given algebraic structure in the following sense.

Essential to the study of any class of algebraic objects are the functions that preserve the given algebraic structure in the following sense.

Definition 2.1. Let G and H be semigroups. A function f: G→ H is a homomorphism provided

If f is injective as a map of sets, f is said to be a monomorphism. If f is surjective, f is called an epimorphism. If f is bijective, f is called an isomorphism. In this case G and H are said to be isomorphic (written G ≅ H). A homomorphism f: G → G is called an endomorphism of G and an isomorphism f: G → G is called an automorphism of G.

If f: G → H and g: H → K are homomorphisms of semigroups, it is easy to see that gf: G → K is also a homomorphism. Likewise the composition of monomorphisms is a monomorphism; similarly for epimorphisms, isomorphisms and automorphisms. If G and H are groups with identities eG and eH respectively and

f: G → H is a homomorphism, then f(e_G) = e_H; however, this is not true for monoids (Exercise 1). Furthermore f(a⁻¹) = f(a)⁻¹ for all a ∈ G (Exercise 1).

EXAMPLE. The map $f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_m$ given by $x \mapsto \bar{x}$ (that is, each integer is mapped onto its equivalence class in $\mathbb{Z}_m$) is an epimorphism of additive groups. $f$ is called the canonical epimorphism of $\mathbb{Z}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_m$. Similarly, the map $g: \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ given by $r \mapsto \bar{r}$ is also an epimorphism of additive groups.

EXAMPLE. Given groups G and H, there are four homomorphisms:
G $\xleftrightarrow{i_1}_{\pi_1}$ G $\times$ H $\xleftrightarrow{i_2}_{\pi_2}$ H, given by $i_1(g) = (g,e)$; $i_2(h) = (e,h)$; $\pi_1(g,h) = g$; $\pi_2(g,h) = h$.
$i_i$ is a monomorphism and $\pi_j$ is an epimorphism ($i,j = 1,2$).
