§7.2 Re-definitions

Now that we've defined a topological space, for nearly all of our metric notions we can write down as the definition the one that required only open sets (which will of course agree with our old definitions when we have a metric space).

§7.2.i Continuity

Here was our motivating example, continuity:

Definition 7.2.1. We say function f: X → Y of topological spaces is continuous at a point p ∈ X if the pre-image of any open neighborhood of f(p) is an open neighborhood of p. The function is continuous if it is continuous at every point.

Thus homeomorphisms carries over: a bijection which is continuous in both directions.

Definition 7.2.2. A homeomorphism of topological spaces (X, τX) and (Y, τY) is a bijection f: X → Y which induces a bijection from τX to τY: i.e. the bijection preserves open sets.

Definition 7.2.4. In a general topological space X, we say that S ⊆ X is closed in X if the complement X \ S is open in X.

Definition 7.2.4. In a general topological space X, we say that S ⊆ X is closed in X if the complement X \ S is open in X.

If $S \subseteq X$ is any set, the closure of $S$, denoted $\overline{S}$, is defined as the smallest closed set containing $S$.

Not everything works:

Remark 7.2.7 (Complete and (totally) bounded are metric properties) — The two metric properties we have seen, "complete" and "(totally) bounded", are not topological properties. They rely on a metric, so as written we cannot apply them to topological spaces. One might hope that maybe, there is some alternate definition (like we saw for "continuous function") that is just open-set based. But Example 6.3.1 showing (0,1) $\cong$ R tells us that it is hopeless.

Remark 7.2.8 (Sequences don't work well) — You could also try to port over the notion of sequences and convergent sequences. However, this turns out to break a lot of desirable properties. Therefore I won't bother to do so, and thus if we are discussing sequences you should assume that we are working with a metric space.

As you might have guessed, there exist topological spaces which cannot be realized as metric spaces (in other words, are not metrizable). One example is just to take X = {a, b, c} and the topology $\tau_X$ = {Ø, {a, b, c}}. This topology is fairly "stupid": it can't tell apart any of the points a, b, c! But any metric space can tell its points apart (because d(x, y) > 0 when x ≠ y).

We'll see less trivial examples later, but for now we want to add a little more sanity condition onto our spaces. There is a whole hierarchy of such axioms, labelled $T_n$ for integers $n$ (with $n = 0$ being the weakest and $n = 6$ the strongest); these axioms are called separation axioms.

By far the most common hypothesis is the $T_2$ axiom, which bears a special name.

Definition 7.3.1. A topological space X is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points p and q in X, there exists an open neighborhood U of p and an open neighborhood V of q such that

In other words, around any two distinct points we should be able to draw disjoint open neighborhoods. Here's a picture to go with above, but not much going on.

图像显示了两个独立的圆形区域。

左侧的圆形区域以蓝色虚线为边界，内部填充为浅蓝色。该区域的中心有一个蓝色的点，旁边标有小写字母“p”。

右侧的圆形区域以红色虚线为边界，内部填充为浅红色。该区域的中心有一个红色的点，旁边标有小写字母“q”。

两个圆形区域大小相似，并排显示在白色背景上。

Question 7.3.2. Show that all metric spaces are Hausdorff.

I just want to define this here so that I can use this word later. In any case, basically any space we will encounter other than the Zariski topology is Hausdorff.

§7.4 Subspaces

Prototypical example for this section: S¹ is a subspace of ℝ².

One can also take subspaces of general topological spaces.

Definition 7.4.1. Given a topological space X, and a subset S ⊆ X, we can make S into a topological space by declaring that the open subsets of S are U ∩ S for open U ⊆ X. This is called the subspace topology.

So for example, if we view S¹ as a subspace of R², then any open arc is an open set, because you can view it as the intersection of an open disk with S¹.

图像展示了两个圆，一个实线圆和一个虚线圆，它们在二维平面R²上相交。

实线圆的上方标有“S¹”。虚线圆与实线圆有两个交点，这两个交点用空心蓝色圆圈表示。连接这两个交点的虚线圆的一部分被加粗并用蓝色实线表示。

§7.5 Connected spaces

Prototypical example for this section: $[0, 1] \cup [2,3]$ is disconnected.

Even in metric spaces, it is possible for a set to be both open and closed.

Definition 7.5.1. A subset S of a topological space X is clopen if it is both closed and open in X. (Equivalently, both S and its complement are open.)

For example, $\emptyset$ and the entire space are examples of clopen sets. In fact, the presence of a nontrivial clopen set other than these two leads to a so-called disconnected space.

Question 7.5.2. Show that a space X has a nontrivial clopen set (one other than Ø and X) if and only if X can be written as a disjoint union of two nonempty open sets.

证明:
(←) Suppose X = A U B, A, B ≠ Ø and both open. Then A, B is both clopen.
(→) Suppose A is that nontrivial clopen set. The X-A is open and A ∩ (X-A) = Ø

We say X is disconnected if there are nontrivial clopen sets, and connected otherwise.
To see why this should be a reasonable definition, it might help to solve Problem 7A†.

Example 7.5.3 (Disconnected and connected spaces)

(a) The metric space

is disconnected (it consists of two disks).

(b) The space $[0, 1] \cup [2, 3]$ is disconnected: it consists of two segments, each of which is a clopen set.

(c) A discrete space on more than one point is disconnected, since every set is clopen in the discrete space.

(d) Convince yourself that the set

is a clopen subset of Q. Hence Q is disconnected too - it has gaps.

(e) [0, 1] is connected.

§7.6 Path-connected spaces

Prototypical example for this section: Walking around in C.

A stronger and perhaps more intuitive notion of a connected space is a path-connected space. The short description: "walk around in the space".

Definition 7.6.1. A path in the space X is a continuous function

Its endpoints are the two points γ(0) and γ(1).

You can think of [0, 1] as measuring "time", and so we'll often write $\gamma(t)$ for $t \in [0, 1]$ (with $t$ standing for "time"). Here's a picture of a path.

好，马上就可以接上HOTT了。(唔，看来得明天了。)

图像展示了一个浅紫色的不规则形状区域，标记为“X”。区域内部有一条黑色的曲线，标记为“γ”。这条曲线从一个点开始，该点标记为“γ(0)”，并终止于另一个点，该点标记为“γ(1)”。在点“γ(1)”处有一个向上的黑色箭头，表示曲线的方向。

Definition 7.6.3. A space X is path-connected if any two points in it are connected by some path.

Exercise 7.6.4 (Path-connected implies connected). Let X = U ⊔ V be a disconnected space. Show that there is no path from a point of U to point V. (If γ: [0, 1] → X, then we get [0, 1] = γ⁻¹(U) ⊔ γ⁻¹(V), but [0, 1] is connected.)

Example 7.6.5 (Examples of path-connected spaces)

• R² is path-connected, since we can "connect" any two points with a straight line.

- The unit circle S¹ is path-connected, since we can just draw the major or minor arc to connect two points.
