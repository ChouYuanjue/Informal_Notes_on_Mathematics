1 Suppose a and b are real numbers, not both 0. Find real numbers c and d such that, considering (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2+b^2, one has (a+bi)/(a^2+b^2) = c+di.

11 Explain why there does not exist $\lambda \in C$ such that
If the number $\lambda$ exists, then $\lambda(2-3i) = (12-5i)$, $\lambda(5+4i) = (7+22i)$. So $(2-3i)(7+22i) = (12-5i)(5+4i)$.
It means $\lambda(2-3i, 5+4i, -6+7i) = (12-5i, 7+22i, -32-9i)$.
$20-17i = 80+23i$. Thus such $\lambda \in C$ does not exist.

1.31 The number -1 times a vector

(-1)v = -v for every v ∈ V.

Proof For $v \in V$, we have

This equation says that (-1)v, when added to v, gives 0. Thus (-1)v is the additive inverse of v, as desired.

EXERCISES 1.B

This shows the extreme of additive inverse, i.e. the additive inverse condition.
Here the 0 on the left side is the number 0, and the 0 on the right side is
the additive identity of V. (The phrase "a condition can be replaced" in a
definition means that the collection of objects satisfying the definition is
unchanged if the original condition is replaced with the new condition.)

Let ∞ and -∞ denote two distinct objects, neither of which is in R.
Define an addition and scalar multiplication on R ∪ {∞} ∪ {-∞} as you
could guess from the notation. Specifically, the sum and product of two
real numbers is as usual, and for t ∈ R define

Is R U {∞} U {−∞} a vector space over R? Explain.

If $u \in U$, then $-u$ [which equals $(-1)u$ by 1.31] is also in $U$ by the third condition above. Hence every element of $U$ has an additive inverse in $U$.

The other parts of the definition of a vector space, such as associativity and commutativity, are automatically satisfied for U because they hold on the larger space V. Thus U is a vector space and hence is a subspace of V.

The three conditions in the result above usually enable us to determine quickly whether a given subset of V is a subspace of V. You should verify all the assertions in the next example.

1.35 Example subspaces

is a subspace of F⁴ if and only if b = 0.

The subspaces of R² are precisely {0}, R², and all lines in R² through the origin. The subspaces of R³ are precisely {0}, R³, all lines in R³ through the origin, and all planes in R³ through the origin. To prove that all these objects are indeed subspaces is easy—the hard part is to show that they are the only subspaces of R² and R³. That task will be easier after we introduce some additional tools in the next chapter.
