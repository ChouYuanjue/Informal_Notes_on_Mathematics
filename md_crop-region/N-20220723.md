图像显示了一个由三条黑色粗线组成的环形结构，背景为白色。这三条线在大部分区域平行排列，形成一个大致的椭圆形。在环形的左侧，这三条线交织在一起，形成一个结。具体来说，从上到下看，最上面的线从中间线的上方穿过，然后从最下面的线的下方穿过；中间的线从最上面的线的下方穿过，然后从最下面的线的上方穿过；最下面的线从中间线的下方穿过，然后从最上面的线的上方穿过。这种交织形成了一个三叶结的结构。

He starts by hopping 1 space at a time (from 1 to 2, then from 2 to 3, and so on). He performs 10 hops in this way.

- He then hops 2 spaces at a time (from 1 to 3, then from 3 to 5, and so on). He performs 10 hops in this way.

- He continues to increase the hop distance every 10 hops: hopping 3 spaces 10 times, then hopping 4 spaces 10 times, and so on.

After Brilli has hopped 10 spaces 10 times, he ends his workout.

When Brilli has completed his workout, which vertex will he be standing on?
Answer: 1 Obviously.

How to prove that $x^{2n} + x^n + 1$ has a factor $x^2 + x + 1$ if and only if $n \not\equiv 0 \pmod 3$?

Asked 2 days ago Modified today Viewed 92 times

Well, I don't know whether it is exactly correct. I get this result when I was dealing with a simple problem "find out the factors of $x^{10} + x^5 + 1$". I put different $n$ into this polynomial and draw the roots in the complex plane by WolframAlpha: $n=4,7,9$.

The distribution of these roots has certain rules: the red angle is half of the blue one, and one red angle comes after one blue angle and make up the whole circle in this way. By observing the pictures, we can easily get the result that is stated in the question.

The following question has been moved to another post: How to prove that $\sum_{i=0}^{k} x^{in}$ have a same factor $P(x)$ if and only if $n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{(k+1)}$?

Also, for $x^{3n} + x^{2n} + x^n + 1$, I infer it has a factor $x^2 + 1$ if and only if $n \neq 0 \pmod 4$. Also see the pictures: $n=2,3,4,5$.

My guess is: For polynomials $x^{kn} + x^{(k-1)n} + \dots + x^{2n} + x^n + 1$, if $n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{(k+1)}$ and $k \ge 2$, they all have a certain factor $P(x)$.

Is that true? How do I find the factor P(x)? How to prove? (I think the method of Cotes' Theorem may be used for it. See T. Needham, Visual Complex Analysis, pp 46-47)]

Welcome to MSE. A question should be written in such a way that it can be understood even by someone who did not read its title. - José Carlos Santos 2 days ago

Please do not ask multiple questions in one post. Here you are asking two questions: (1) about $x^{2n} + x^n + 1$ and (2) about $\sum_{i=0}^{k} x^{in}$. Please make a separate question for one of these and keep the other question in this post. - insipidintegrator 2 days ago

Notice that $x^2 + x + 1 = \frac{x^3-1}{x-1}$, so working mod $x^2+x+1$ you can reduce all the exponents mod 3.

Because of $\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2}$ are roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ it is equivalent to prove that

for the proposed values of n. In other words that

Since $(x^2 + x + 1)(x - 1) = x^3 - 1$, the roots of $(x^2 + x + 1)$ are $\{\zeta, \zeta^2\}$ where $\zeta$ is a primitive cubic root of 1.

When $n \not\equiv 0 \pmod 3$ there is an equality of sets $\{\zeta^n, \zeta^{2n}\} = \{\zeta, \zeta^2\}$ which shows that $\zeta$ and $\zeta^2$ are also roots of $x^{2n} + x^n + 1$, thus the divisibility of polynomials.

On the other hand when $n \equiv 0 \pmod 3$ we have $\zeta^n = \zeta^{2n} = 1$ so $\{\zeta, \zeta^2\}$ are not roots of $x^{2n} + x^n + 1$.

This proof is nice, it seems that it isn't too much more to prove a more general statement this way for all cyclotomic polynomials that $\Phi_k(x^n)$ is divisible by $\Phi_k(x)$ iff gcd(k, n) = 1, since otherwise we don't have a bijection of the set of roots.

We can also see this in terms of the factorizations themselves. The "template" would be
$u^2 + u + 1$
As "base" examples, we have
$= \frac{u^3 - 1}{u - 1}, u \neq 1$.

for these polynomials, we are able to write the numerator in each quotient as a "difference of two squares", however,

since we are unable to use a "difference of two squares"; it is easily checked that this polynomial is irreducible over ℝ.

For the general cases, we actually need to consider the parity of $n$.

and similarly for $2p'$,

which simply returns our polynomial, which is biquadratic in 3m and irreducible over ℝ;

which returns irreducible biquadratic factors, none of which are $x^2 + x + 1$. A couple of examples of this latter case are

Viewed in this way, the zeroes of $u^2 + u + 1$ are the three unit-modulus zeroes of $z^3 - 1$, $z_k = e^{i \cdot 2k\pi/3}$, $k = 0, 1, 2$, with $z_0 = 1$ "removed". Finding the zeroes of $w^{2n} + w^n + 1$ substitutes $u = w^n$, generating three "families" of $n$-th-roots.

- $w^n = z_0$ which are excluded by the condition $z^n \neq 1$;
$\Rightarrow w_{0,j} = e^{i \cdot [0 + 2j\pi]/n}$,
$= e^{i \cdot 6j\pi/(3n)}$

This produces the $2n$ complex zeroes expected for the polynomial.

For $n = 3m \pm 1$, it is possible to find integer solutions for $j$ in either
$\frac{(2+6j)\cdot\pi}{3n} = \frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{3} \Rightarrow j = \frac{n-1}{3}, \frac{2n-1}{3}$
or
$\frac{(4+6j)\cdot\pi}{3n} = \frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{3} \Rightarrow j = \frac{n-2}{3}, \frac{2n-2}{3}$.
So the $0 \le j \le n-1$.

How to prove that $\sum_{i=0}^{k} x^{in}$ have a same factor $P(x)$ if and only if $n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{(k+1)}$?

If $P_k(x) = P(x) = x^k + x^{(k-1)} + \dots + x^2 + x + 1$, then with $Q_{k,n}(x) = Q(x) = x^{kn} + x^{(k-1)n} + \dots + x^{2n} + x^n + 1$ we have that $Q(y) = P(y^n)$.

Since the roots of P are precisely the k + 1 roots of unity distinct from 1, so $e^{2\pi im/(k+1)}$, m = 1, ... k we get that the roots of Q are precisely

Now if $(n, k+1)=1$, one can easily see that one can solve in $c=1, \dots, k, r=0, \dots, n-1$ the equation $r(k+1)-cn=m$ for every $m=1, \dots, k$. One first solves $r(k+1)-cn=1$ with $(c, k+1)=1$, and then one gets the solutions for $m=2, \dots, k$ as $2c, \dots, kc$ (reducing them modulo $k+1$), which are none divisible by $k+1$, so are indeed in $1, \dots, k$ modulo $k+1$.

But this means that for all such n we have that Pk/Qk,n so indeed all Qk,n have that as a common subfactor.

If $(n, k+1) = d > 1$, then we get as roots of $Q$ only the nontrivial roots of unity of order $(k+1)$ (and of course roots of unity of higher order involving $n$) that are of the form $e^{2\pi idm/(k+1)}$, $m = 1, \dots, (k+1)/d$. So in general, there is no common factor.
