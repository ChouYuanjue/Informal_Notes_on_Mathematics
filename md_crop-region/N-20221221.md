阳性常二天，继续来看卦。上次刻备性了。

So, metric spaces need not be complete, like Q. But we certainly would like them to be complete, and in light of the following theorem this is not unreasonable.

Theorem 6.2.6 (Completion)

Every metric space can be "completed", i.e. made into a complete space by adding in some points.

We won't need this construction at all, so it's left as Problem 6C†.

The completion of Q is R.

(In fact, by using a modified definition of completion not depending on the real numbers, other authors often use this as the definition of R.)

§6.3 Let the buyer beware

There is something suspicious about both these notions: neither are preserved under homeomorphism!

Example 6.3.1 (Something fishy is going on here)

Let M = (0,1) and N = R. As we saw much earlier M and N are homeomorphic.
However:

(0,1) is totally bounded, but not complete.

• ℝ is complete, but not bounded.

This is the first hint of something going awry with the metric. As we progress further into our study of topology, we will see that in fact open and closed sets (which we

motivated by using the metric) are the notion that will really shine later on. I insist on introducing the metric first so that the standard pictures of open and closed sets make sense, but eventually it becomes time to remove the training wheels.

(我才意识到他前面还讲过一段拓扑)

Definition 2.4.1. Let M and N be metric spaces. A function f: M → N is a homeomorphism if it is a bijection, and both f: M → N and its inverse f⁻¹: N → M are continuous. We say M and N are homeomorphic.

Needless to say, homeomorphism is an equivalence relation.

You might be surprised that we require $f^{-1}$ to also be continuous. Here's the reason: you can show that if $\phi$ is an isomorphism of groups, then $\phi^{-1}$ also preserves the group

operation, hence $\phi^{-1}$ is itself an isomorphism. The same is not true for continuous bijections, which is why we need the new condition.

Example 2.4.2 (Homeomorphism ≠ continuous bijection)

(a) There is a continuous bijection from [0, 1) to the circle, but it has no continuous inverse.

(b) Let M be a discrete space with size |R|. Then there is a continuous function M → R which certainly has no continuous inverse.

图像显示了一个黑色粗线条绘制的圆形。圆形的顶部有一个小的蓝色圆点，该圆点位于圆形的外边缘。蓝色圆点下方，圆内，有一个手写的黑色数学符号，看起来像一个带有下标“0”的希腊字母“kappa”（κ₀）。图像背景是带有水平线的白色纸张，这些线条在圆形内部和外部都可见。

由左及右很显然连续，但对于加点，由右向左时，(方向会→0，少方向会→1，不连续

Note that this is the topologist's definition of "same" - homeomorphisms are "continuous deformations". Here are some examples.

Example 2.4.3 (Examples of homeomorphisms)

(a) Any space M is homeomorphic to itself through the identity map.

(b) The old saying: a doughnut (torus) is homeomorphic to a coffee cup. (Look this up if you haven't heard of it.)

(c) The unit circle S¹ is homeomorphic to the boundary of the unit square. Here's one bijection between them, after an appropriate scaling:

图像显示一个正方形，其内部包含一个圆。圆的圆心位于正方形的中心。从圆心向圆周引出一条半径，这条半径的末端（圆周上的点）连接到正方形上边缘的一个点。这条连接线段由两个黑色实心圆点标记，一个在圆周上，另一个在正方形上边缘。圆心处也有一个黑色实心圆点。

Example 2.4.5 (Homeomorphisms really don't preserve size)

Surprisingly, the open interval (-1,1) is homeomorphic to the real line R! One bijection is given by

with the inverse being given by $t \mapsto \frac{2}{\pi} \arctan(t)$.

This might come as a surprise, since (-1,1) doesn't look that much like ℝ; the former is "bounded" while the latter is "unbounded".

补充一下一个定理的证明（之前应该也提到过）

Theorem 2.6.11 (Open set condition)

A function $f: M \to N$ of metric spaces is continuous if and only if the pre-image of every open set in $N$ is open in $M$.

Now assume f is continuous. First, suppose V is an open subset of the metric space N; let U = fpre(V). Pick x ∈ U, so y = f(x) ∈ V; we want an open neighborhood of x inside U.

该图像展示了两个集合 M 和 N，以及一个从 M 到 N 的函数 f。

左侧的集合 M 内部包含一个点 x。以 x 为中心，有一个半径为 δ 的虚线圆，表示一个开球。这个开球被一个更大的虚线圆包围，这个更大的虚线圆表示集合 U，并且 U 被标记为 $U = f^{\text{pre}}(V)$。

右侧的集合 N 内部包含一个点 y。以 y 为中心，有一个半径为 ε 的虚线圆，表示一个开球。这个开球被一个更大的虚线圆包围，这个更大的虚线圆表示集合 V。

一个带有箭头和标签 f 的水平线连接了集合 M 和 N，表示函数 f 将 M 映射到 N。

图像中展示的关系是，对于集合 N 中的开集 V，其在函数 f 下的原像 $U = f^{\text{pre}}(V)$ 是集合 M 中的一个开集。更具体地，对于 N 中包含点 y 的开球（半径为 ε），其原像 U 包含 M 中包含点 x 的开球（半径为 δ）。

As V is open, there is some small ε-neighborhood around y which is contained inside V. By continuity of f, we can find a δ such that the δ-neighborhood of x gets mapped by f into the ε-neighborhood in N, which in particular lives inside V. Thus the δ-neighborhood lives in U, as desired.

回到一开始的部分。我要纠正上次笔记的一个错误：metric space里集合可以 clopen

Exercise 6.4.3. Let M = [0, 1] U (2, 3). Show that [0, 1] and (2, 3) are both open and closed in M.

证明: We only need to show [0, 1] and (2, 3) are both open, which can show that they are also both closed automatically.

It may not make sense, but notice that we're considering in M, and B₂(0) in M look like this:

图像包含两个主要部分。

左侧部分展示了一个数轴，上面标有数字0和1。从0点出发，有一条橙色的线段延伸到数轴上的某个点，该点位于0和1之间。这条橙色线段上方手写着“B 1/2 (0)”。从0点出发，还有一条蓝色的弧线，其半径为1/2，弧线从数轴上方开始，向左上方延伸，然后向下弯曲，与数轴相交。弧线上方有一条蓝色的箭头线段，从0点指向弧线上的一个点，该线段旁边手写着“1/2”。

右侧部分展示了一条水平线段，线段的两端各有一个空心圆圈。左侧的空心圆圈下方手写着数字2，右侧的空心圆圈下方手写着数字3。

And it turns out that the sets are open in M.
