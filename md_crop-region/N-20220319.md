A Review at Calculus

Having defined real numbers (may mention in the following notes), the first thing we will study is sequences. We will want to study what it means for a sequence to converge. Intuitively, we would like to say that 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... converges to 0, while 1, 2, 3, 4, ... diverges. However, the actual formal definition of convergence is rather hard to get right, and historically there have been failed attempts that produced spurious results.

Definition Sequence

A sequence is, formally, a function $a: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$). Usually (i.e. always), we write $a_n$ instead of $a(n)$. Instead of $a$, we usually write it as $(a_n)$, $(a_n)_1^\infty$ or $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ to indicate it is a sequence.

Definition Limits of sequence

Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence and $l \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $a_n$ converges to $l$, tends to $l$, or $a_n \to l$, if for all $\epsilon > 0$, there is some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $n > N$, we have $|a_n - l| < \epsilon$. In symbols, this says

We say $\ell$ is the limit of $(a_n)$.

Let's take a look at an example from Demidovich. Suppose $x_n = \frac{n}{n+1} (n \in \mathbb{N})$,
prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = 1$.
Proof: That is, prove that for any given $\varepsilon > 0$, find out the $N = N(\varepsilon)$ that
when $n > N$, we have $|x_n - 1| < \varepsilon$.
Since $|x_n - 1| = \left| \frac{n}{n+1} - 1 \right| = \left| \frac{n - (n+1)}{n+1} \right| = \left| \frac{-1}{n+1} \right| = \frac{1}{n+1}$,
we only need to let $\frac{1}{n+1} < \varepsilon$, i.e. $n+1 > \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, so $n > \frac{1}{\varepsilon} - 1$.
So let $N = N(\varepsilon) = \left\lceil \frac{1}{\varepsilon} - 1 \right\rceil$.

Let A ⊆ ℝ and let f: A → ℝ. We say

or $f(x) \to \ell$ as $x \to a$, if

We couldn't care less what happens when x = a, hence the strict inequality
0 < |x - a|. In fact, f doesn't even have to be defined at x = a.

Definition Derivative of function

The derivative of a function f(x) with respect to x, interpreted as the rate of change of f(x) with x, is

A function f(x) is differentiable at x if the limit exists (i.e. the left-hand and right-hand limits are equal).

Definition O and o notations

(i) "$f(x) = o(g(x))$ as $x \to x_0$" if $\lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0$. Intuitively, $f(x)$ is much smaller than $g(x)$.

(ii) "f(x) = O(g(x)) as x → x₀" if f(x)/g(x) is bounded as x → x₀. Intuitively, f(x) is about as big as g(x).

Note that for $f(x) = O(g(x))$ to be true, $\lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ need not exist.

Usually, x₀ is either 0 or infinity. Clearly, we have f(x) = o(g(x)) implies f(x) = O(g(x)).

Given f(x) = F(g(x)), then

Theorem 2 (Product rule)

Give f(x) = u(x)v(x). Then

Theorem 3 (Quotient rule)

Give $f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}$, then

Theorem 4 (Leibniz's rule)

Given f = uv, then

where f^(n) is the n-th derivative of f.

Definition Integration

An integral is the limit of a sum, e.g.

For example, we can take $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{N}$ and $x_n = a + n\Delta x$. Note that an integral need not be defined with this particular $\Delta x$ and $x_n$. The term "integral" simply refers to any limit of a sum (The usual integrals we use are a special kind known as Riemann integral, which we will study formally in analysis). Pictorially, we have

该图像展示了一个二维坐标系，其中包含x轴和y轴。x轴上标有从左到右的刻度点：0、a、x1、x2、x3、...、xn、xn+1、...、b。y轴上标有0。

图像中有一条从左下向右上弯曲的曲线，这条曲线在y轴上方，并逐渐上升。

在曲线下方，x轴上方，有一系列矩形。这些矩形的底部位于x轴上，顶部与曲线相切或略低于曲线。

第一个矩形的左边界在x=a处，右边界在x=x1处。
第二个矩形的左边界在x=x1处，右边界在x=x2处。
第三个矩形的左边界在x=x2处，右边界在x=x3处。
在x3和xn之间有省略号，表示有更多的矩形。
在xn和xn+1之间有一个矩形。
在xn+1和b之间有省略号，表示有更多的矩形，最后一个矩形的右边界在x=b处。

这些矩形的高度随着x值的增大而增大，与曲线的上升趋势一致。

The area under the graph from $x_n$ to $x_{n+1}$ is $f(x_n)\Delta x + O(\Delta x^2)$. Provided that $f$ is differentiable, the total area under the graph from $a$ to $b$ is
