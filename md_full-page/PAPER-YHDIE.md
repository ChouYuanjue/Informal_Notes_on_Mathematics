The Mappping of the Main Functions and Different Variations of YH-DIE

Gilbert B. Mason, Yuanjue Chou and Springer E. Pind

YH-DIE must have continuity. Given the basic algebraic clusters of homogeneous configurations, we can get the basic three equations:

YH-DIE has become a fusion point and access point in the fields of algebraic geometry and partial differential equations, and its mapping on multidimensional algebraic clusters or manifolds is very special. The minimal surface equation is a special case.

Key words: complete Riemannian manifolds; entire solutions: minimal graphs; differential equat: algebraic variety

Introduction

Throughout the paper, the word yh-basic will mean defined on all of the basic form of YH-DIE.and the word yh-varia will refers to the variants of the equation.

Taking into account the huge literature on hypersurfaces with prescribed mean curvature, notably on minimal and constant mean curvature (CMC) ones, some choices have to be made, and we decided to exclusively focus on a little of the references considering(just like the parts about another yk-voria:

Thus, unfortunately, important works concerning embedded (immersed) hypersurfaces have been omitted, unless they provide new results in the graphical case. Concerning the prescribed mean curvature problem in Euclidean space, that will be brielly recalled in the next section (if we write), we recommend the survey (46) for an excellent account, that also includes Liouville theorems for more general operators

(We require that Gtx, x) is not equal to 0, and 0 << 1. On this basis, we define the function (x) about x as the mapping of G(x, f(x)) on p(x), η(x) is the Yuheng Operator, or YIHO for short. We may also introduce its nature in detail in future articles.)

Manifold Mapping

Ambient manifolds of the type R x M leave aside various cases of interest, notably interesting representations of the hyperbolic space H+. This and other examples motivated us to consider graphs in more general ambient manifolds. M ((47; 9; 49)), that foliate topologically as products RX M along the flow lines of relevant, in general not parallel, vector fields. A sufficiently large class.

for our purposes is that of warped products
M=RX M
g=ds² + h(s)g.
(2.1)
for some positive h∈ C²(R). Note that X = h(s)∂, is a conformal field with
geodesic flow lines. Given v : M → R, we define the graph
Σ" = {(s,x) ∈ R × M, v = v(x)},
that we call a geodesic graph.
Further ambient spaces, and define the mapping of G(x) on H+1
For instance, H+1 admits the following representations:
(i) H+1 = R ×e-s/a R", where the slice of constant s is called a horizontal
sphere and is a flattened European. The average curvature of the Gilead
space in the direction of -∂, is 1. Next, change the variable x = -log x
in the upper half space model:
H+1 = {(s,x) ∈ R × R" : x > 0}
(ii) H+1 = R ×cosh, H", with the slices {s = s} for constant s, called
hyperspheres, being totally umbilical hyperbolic spaces of normalized mean
curvature H = tanh(s) in the direction of -∂, and sectional curvature
-(cosh s)-2.
(iii) H+1 = R ×G(s), H", which uses the main fuction in yh-basic has named
hypersphengvus. This follows by changing variables s = -φ(x) in the
upper half space model
Σ" = {(f(x),f(x)) ∈ R × R" : s < 0}
Bootstrap Assumptions
In the following, we shall use I' to denote a string of commutation vector
fields where at most i of them are weighted. Because we only commute with
two derivatives, we have that 0 ≤ i ≤ 2. The energy associated with I' is
allowed to grow like (1+r).
We shall consider two separate energies, E₁[γ](s)² and E₂[γ](s)². They
shall both measure a supremum of energy on the time slices Σ, and outgoing
cones truncated above by Σ,. We take
E₁(s) = sup Σ ||d²-i γ||L²(Σ) + ||d²-i γ||L²(Σ)
and we take
E₂(s) = sup Σ ||d²-i γ||L²(Σ) + (1+r)-3 ||d²-i γ||L²(Σ)
Note that we will usually work with the quantities E₁, E₂, which are the square
roots of the energies E₁², E₂². This is purely a notational convenience.
We shall now take various bootstrap assumptions on γ. The remainder of
the proof of the global stability of the plane waves will involve recovering the
bootstrap assumptions. Most of these bootstrap assumptions will be recovered
easily from the various embedding theorems along with some minor arguments
after recovering the bootstrap assumptions for the energy. We have listed all
of them to record all of the estimates we shall use in recovering the bootstrap
assumptions for the energies E₁(γ)² and E₂(γ)², which are the only steps that
require controlling nonlinear terms.

In the following, we fix some large, positive p in terms of δ. More precisely,
we pick
p ≥ 2/δ
(3.2)
This p will be used for angular Sobolev embeddings. Indeed, we shall use
proposition, which gives us control of the an appropriate mixed Lebesgue
space norm in terms of commuting with a single weighted commutation field.
The choice of p must be large enough in order to take advantage of the volume
of Σs.
With Γ an arbitrary commutation field and Γ an arbitrary string of
commutation fields where at most i of them are weighted, we let T be the
maximal time such that the following bootstrap assumptions are true:

Continuation of discussion regarding bootstrap assumptions
We shall improve the bounds from ε to heing Cε. This will recover the
bootstrap assumptions when ε is sufficiently small, giving us the desired result.
The main remaining difficulty in establishing Theorem is recovering the
bootstrap assumptions on the energy. We have the following proposition.
Proposition 3.1. The bootstrap assumptions in Section ?? imply that E₁(T) ≤
Cε and E₂(T) ≤ Cε.
We shall now assume that we have shown Proposition 3.1. These estimates
are established. We shall show that. a result of this, we can recover all of
the other bootstrap assumptions. For each of these, the portion of the estimates

where $t \ll 10$ follow from the usual Sobolev embedding on a spacetime cube of side length 100, so we will only worry about the parts of these norms that have $\tau > 2$.

We shall first use Proposition to recover the pointwise bootstrap assumptions on $\partial_t$ and $\partial_x$. They are direct consequences of the Klainerman-Sobolev inequalities we have established.

Lemma 3.2. Assuming Proposition 3.1, we recover bootstrap assumptions (3.5) and (3.6) and improve the bound to $C_e$. Namely, we derive the estimates
1.  $\|(1+|u|)^{-1}(1+|b|)^{-1}\partial_y(t,r,w)\|_{L^2} \leq CE_2(t)$.
2.  $\|(1+|u|+r)^{-1}\partial_y(t,r,w)\|_{L^2} \leq CF_2(t)$.

Proof. The first estimate follows from applying the proposition and noting that the right hand side is controlled by $L^2_t$ recovered in Proposition 3.1. The second estimate similarly follows similarly using Proposition instead when $|u| \geq \frac{1}{r}$ and follows directly from the first estimate when $|u| \leq \frac{1}{r}$.

We shall now recover the spacetime $L^2$ estimates on the good derivatives.

Lemma 3.3. Assuming Proposition 3.1, we recover bootstrap assumptions (3.7), (3.8), (3.9), namely we have that
1.  $\|(1+|u|)^{-1}\frac{1}{r}\partial_y\|_{L^2} \leq C_e$.
2.  $\|(1+|u|)^{-1}\frac{1}{r}\partial_t\|_{L^2} \leq C_e$.
3.  $\|(1+r)^{-1}(1+|u|)^{-1}\frac{1}{r}\partial_r\|_{L^2} \leq C_e$.

Proof. The first two parts follow immediately from the fact that $E_1(T)^2$ controls the characteristic energy along with the fact that $(1+|u|)^{-6}$ is integrable in $u$. We now turn to the third part.

We begin by noting that, as a consequence of Proposition 3.1, we have that
$\int_{|x| \leq r} \partial_t^2 \gamma \partial_r^2 \gamma r'r dxdtdr \leq Ce^2(1+r)^{2a}$ (3.20)

for every $s \leq T$, where we are integrating on the cone $C_t$. Thus, with $h(u,v) = \int_{|x| \leq r} \partial_t^2 \gamma \partial_r^2 \gamma r'r dxdr$ and integrating by parts in $u$, we have that
$\int_{|x| \leq r} (1+|u|)^{-6} hdv \leq (1+|T|)^{-4} \int_{|x| \leq r} h(u,v')dv'dr$
$+2\delta \int_{|x| \leq r} (1+\frac{1}{2}(v+u))^{-16} \int_{|x| \leq r} h(u,v')dv'dr$. (3.21)

Now, we note that
$\int_{|x| \leq r} h(u,v')dv'dr \leq Ce^2(1+(1+\frac{1}{2}(v+u))^{-16}$.

Thus, we have that
$\delta \int_{|x| \leq r} (1+\frac{1}{2}(v+u))^{-16} \int_{|x| \leq r} h(u,v')dv'dr \leq Ce^2 \int_{|x| \leq r} (1+\frac{1}{2}(v+u))^{-16} dv \leq C \delta$.

and similarly for the first term in (3.21). Multiplying (3.21) by $(1+|u|)^{-6}$, integrating in $u$, we get that
$\|(1+|u|)^{-1}(1+r)^{-1}\frac{1}{r}\partial_r\|_{L^2} \leq \delta \int_{|x| \leq r} (1+|u|)^{-6} \int_{|x| \leq r} (1+\frac{1}{2}(v+u))^{-16} \partial_t^2 \gamma \partial_r^2 \gamma r'r dxdtdr$
$\leq \delta \int_{|x| \leq r} (1+|u|)^{-6} \int_{|x| \leq r} (1+\frac{1}{2}(v+u))^{-16} du dv$
$\leq C \delta e^2$.

where we have used the fact that $(1+|u|)^{-6}$ is integrable in $u$. This gives us the desired result.

We now recover the $L^2_t L^2_x$ estimates on all derivatives and the $L^2_t L^4_x$ estimates on good derivatives. They are both a consequence of the $L^2_t L^4_x$ Klainerman-Sobolev inequality and an interpolation argument.

Commutative Diagrams

Consider an incremental filter phase family $\{S_\alpha\}_{\alpha \leq 1}$ of the multiplicative subset of $A$ (we stipulate that $\alpha \leq \beta$ is $S_\alpha \subseteq S_\beta$, and set $S$ is the multiplicative subset $\bigcup_\alpha S_\alpha$. For $\alpha \leq \beta$, we let $\rho_{\alpha \beta} : S_\alpha \rightarrow S_\beta$, and according to (4.22)

$(S, T, U)$ are the three multiplicative subsets of $A$, and the inductive system of the ring formed by $S \subset T \subset U$. See (24: 8)), so that an inductive limit cycle $A'$ can be defined.

Change the multiplicative subset and make $\varphi$ an isomorphism
Let $\rho_\alpha$ be a canonical homomorphism $S_\alpha^{-1}A \rightarrow A'$, and let $\varphi_\beta : S_\beta^{-1}A \rightarrow A'$, so according to (3), for $\alpha \leq \beta$, we can always have $\varphi_\alpha = \varphi_\beta \circ \rho_{\alpha \beta}$, and we can uniquely define a homomorphic $\varphi : A' \rightarrow S^{-1}A$, making the diagrams.

So we can uniquely define a homomorphic $\varphi : A' \rightarrow S^{-1}A$, so that the graphs (where $\alpha < \beta$) are exchanged. This $\varphi$ is an isomorphism. In fact, by the way of constructing $\varphi$ you can immediately know that it is full.

On the other hand, if $\rho_\alpha(a/s_\alpha) \subset A'$ satisfies $\varphi(\rho_\alpha(a/s_\alpha)) = 0$, then there is $a/s_\alpha = u$ in $S^{-1}A$. In other words, you can find $s \in S$ makes $sa = 0$. However, you can find $\beta \geq \alpha$ makes $s \in S(\beta)$, so $\rho_\alpha(a/s_\alpha) = \rho_\beta(sa/ss_\alpha) = 0$ It can be seen that $\varphi$ is single. The same method also applies to $A$ modulates $M$, which defines the following canonical isomorphism

$\lim S_\alpha^{-1}A \rightarrow (\lim S_\alpha)^{-1}A$.

$\lim S_\alpha^{-1}M \rightarrow (\lim S_\alpha)^{-1}M$

Definition 4.1. Suppose $L_1, L_2$ are quasigroups. Then a triple $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ of maps from $L_1$ to $L_2$ is a homotopy from $L_1$ to $L_2$ if for any $p,q \in L_1$,
$\alpha(p) \beta(q) = \gamma(pq)$. (4.23)

If $(\alpha, \alpha, \alpha)$ is a homotopy, then $\alpha$ is a quasigroup homomorphism. If each of the maps $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ is a bijection, then $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ is an isotopy. An isotopy from a quasigroup to itself is an autotopy. The set of all autotopies of a quasigroup is clearly a group under composition. If $(\alpha, \alpha, \alpha)$ is an autotopy, then $\alpha$ is an automorphism of $L$, and the group of automorphisms is denoted by Aut$(L)$.

The second isomorphism is still functoric for $M$.

Properties of Base-Θ⁺-bridges, Base-Θ⁻-bridges of YH-DIE
Relative to a fixed collection of initial data:

(i) The set of isomorphisms between two D-Θ⁺ bridges forms a torsor over the group
F⁺ = [±1] × ((±1]⁺)

- where the first (respectively, second) factor corresponds to poly-automorphisms of the sort described in (15) Example 6.2, (ii) (respectively. Example 6.2, (iii)). Moreover, the first factor may be thought of as corresponding to the induced isomorphisms of F⁺ groups between the index sets of the capsules involved.

(ii) The set of isomorphisms between two D-Θ⁺⁺ bridges forms an F⁺⁺ torsor i.e., more precisely, a torsor over a finite group that is equipped with a natural outer isomorphism to F⁺⁺. Moreover, this set of isomorphisms maps bijectively, by considering the induced bijections, to the set of isomorphisms of F⁺⁺-torsors between the index sets of the capsules involved.

(iii) The set of isomorphisms between two D-Θ⁺⁺ Hodge theaters forms a[±1]-torsor. Moreover, this set of isomorphisms maps bijectively, by considering the induced bijections, to the set of isomorphisms of F⁺-groups between the index sets of the capsules involved.

(iv) Given a D-Θ⁺ bridge and a D-Θ⁺⁺ bridge, the set of capsule-t full polyisomorphisms between the respective capsules of D-prime-strips which allow one to glue the given D-Θ⁺ and D-Θ⁺⁺-bridges together to form a D-Θ⁺⁺ Hodge theater forms a torsor over the graph

F⁺ = F⁺ × ((±1]⁺)

- where the first factor corresponds to the F⁺ of (ii); the subgroup (±1}×({±1}) corresponds to the group of (i). Moreover, the first factor may be thought of as corresponding to the induced isomorphisms of F⁺-torsors between the index sets of the capsules involved.

(v) Given a D-Θ⁺-bridge [simple -cf. the discussion of Example 6.2,(i)] functorial algorithm for constructing, up to an F⁺ indeterminacy [cf. (ii), (iv)], from the given D-Θ⁺⁺ bridge a D-Θ⁺⁺ Hodge theater whose underlying D-Θ⁺⁺-bridge is the given D-Θ⁺⁺-bridge.

Different Variations

Suppose we have the equation (we just call equations like it yh-varia-basic-PDEs, or vi vbps for short)

fxx + fxy + xfy = 0 (5.24)

and we would like to transform the equation from the [x, y] variables to the [u, v] variables, where

u = x, v = x/y (5.25)

Note that the inverse transformation is given by x = u, y = u/v. We define g(u, v) to be equal to the function f(x, y) when written in the new variables. That is,

f(x, y) = g(u, v) = g(x, x/y)

Now we create the needed derivative terms, carefully applying the chain rule. For example, by differentiating equation 5.25 with respect to x, we obtain

fₓ(x, y) = g₁(u) ∂u/∂x + g₂(v) ∂v/∂x = g₁(x) + g₂(x) (1/y)

= g₁ + 1/y g₂

where we have used a subscript of "1" ("2") to indicate a derivative with respect to the first (second) argument of the function g(u, v)(i.e., g₁(u, v) = g(u, v)). Use of this "slot notation" tends to minimize errors. In a like manner, we find

fᵧ(x, y) = g₁(u) ∂u/∂y + g₂(v) ∂v/∂y = g₂(x) ∂/∂y (x/y)

= -x/y² g₂ = -v²/u g₂

Transforming partial dierential yh-basic equations

The second order derivatives can be calculated similarly:

fₓₓ(x, y) = ∂/∂x (fₓ(x, y)) = ∂/∂x (g₁ + 1/y g₂)

= g₁₁ + 2v/u g₁₂ + v²/u² g₂₂

fₓᵧ(x, y) = ∂/∂y (-x/y² g₂) = -v²/u g₂₁ - v²/u² g₁₂

fᵧᵧ(x, y) = ∂/∂y (-x/y² g₂) = v²/u g₂₁ + v²/u² g₂₂

Finally, then, we can determine what equation 5.24 looks like in the new variables:

0=fxx+fyy+xfz
=(811+2812+822)+(2+2)+(30)
Euler Transformation of yh-vario and transform into G(x)
Then, let's see the transformations of yh-varia.

Given the first order partial differential equation in two independent variables, φ(x, y, z, p, q) = 0 (with, as usual, p=zx, q=zy, and zx/0 the transformation

x = Zx
y = Y
z = XZx - Z
p = P
q = Q

is known as the Euler transformation. Note that Zy + Zz = 0
Under this transformation, the original equation transforms into φ(Z,Y, XZx - Z, X, -Zy) = 0.

As an example, the equation G(x,y,z,p,q) = 0 becomes. under the Euler transformation, G(Z,Y, XZx - Z) = 0. As another example, the Clairaut partial differential equation φ = z - (xzx + yzy + f(zx,zy)) = 0 is transformed into F = Z - YZy + f(X, -Zy) = 0. Note that this latter equation is really an ordinary differential equation for z = Z(Y) (the variable X acts as a parameter).

(In next paper, we will also talk about the same topic of YII-DIE. This paper mean talks the different variations of basic partial differential equations of YH-DIE. Because of the space, integral equations and heat conduction partial differential equations will be written in the next paper.)

Gradient Estimates in Rx M
As we saw above, under general assumptions on d, f, t solutions of

Du/(√1+|Du|²) = b(x)f(x)|dΩ| on M

indeed satisfy f(a) = 0, in particular

Du/(√1+|Du|²) = 0 on M. (6.26)

However, to infer the constancy of ir solving (6.26), one needs rather different arguments (and more binding assumptions) than those leading to the results in the previous section; indeed, while the above theorems apply to differential inequalities, those in this section are very specific to the equality case, unless in the special situation when M has slow volume growth. This consideration is not surprising, as it parallels the of harmonic functions: positive solutions of Δu = 0 are constant on each complete manifold with Ric ≥ 0 by (58: 500, while the constancy of every positive solution of Δu ≤ 0 is equivalent to the

parabolicity of M (cf. (62; 60)) that, for complete manifolds with Ric > 0, is equivalent to the slow volume growth condition

∫∞ |sds/B1| = ∞. (6.27)

As a matter of fact, (6.27) is sufficient for the parabolicity of a complete manifold M, regardless to any curvature condition (cf. (60, Thm. 7.5)).
Ricci curvature and gradient estimate for minimal graphs
Our approach in (7) to obtain (47) Theorem 1.1 still relies on a gradient estimate. Precisely, we prove

Theorem 6.1 ((7)). Let M be a complete manifold of dimension m≥ 2 satisfying

Ric ≥ -(m-1)κ², (6.28)

for some constant κ ≥ 0. Let Ω C M be an open subset and let u C∞(Ω) be a positive solution of (6.26) on Ω. If either

(i) Ω has locally finise perimeter and

lim inf r→0 log|∂Ω∩Br|/r² < ∞, or

(ii) u ∈ C(Ω) wul is constart on ∂Ω.

Then

√1+|Du|² / eκu√u²-1 ≤ max {1, lim sup x→∂Ω √1+|Du(x)|² / eκu(x)√u(x)²-1} on Ω. (6.29)

In the particular case Ω = M.

√1+|Du|² ≤ eκu√u²-1 on M. (6.30)

If equality holds in (6.30) at some point, dien κ = 0 and u is constart.

Despite we found no explicit example, we feel likely that the bound (6.30) be sharp also for κ > 0, in the sense that the constant κ√m-1 cannot be improved. Our estimate should be compared to the one for positive harmonic Functions on manifolds satisfying (6.28), obtained by P. Li and J. Wang (18) by refining Cheng Yau's argument:

|Du| ≤ (m-1)κu on M. (6.31)

and its version for sets with boundary in [65 Thm. 2.24]:

|Du|/(m-1)κu ≤ max {1, lim sup x→∂Ω |Du(x)|/(m-1)κu(x)} on Ω. (6.32)

Ricci curvature and gradient estimate for CMC graphs
The above method allows for generalizations to the CMC case, obtained in the very recent (56), that apply to the rigidity of capillary graphs over unbounded regions. We detail the application in the next section. Although the guiding idea is the same as the one for Theorem 6.1, the difficulty to deal with nonzero H makes the statement of the next result, and its proof, more involved.

Theorem 6.2 ((56)). Let M be a complete manifold of dimension m > 2 satisfying

Ric > -(m-1)k² on M

for some constant k > 0. Let Ω ⊂ M be an open subset and let u ∈ C∞(Ω) be a positive solution of

(√(1 + |Du|²)) = mH on Ω,

for some H ∈ R. Suppose that either (i) or (ii) of Theorem 6.1 are satisfied. Let C ≥ 0 and A ≥ 1 satisfy

- if H < 0, mH² + C² - (m - 1)k² ≥ 0 (6.33)

- if H ≥ 0, mH² - (C²/A) + (C² - (m - 1)k²)(A²/A²) - 1 ≥ 0, (6.34)

mHCA + 2(C² - (m - 1)k²) ≥ 0. (6.35)

Then,

√(1 + |Du|²) / e^(Cu) ≤ max {A, lim sup (√(1 + |Du(x)|²) / e^(Cu(x)))} on Ω. (6.36)

In particular, if Ω = M,

√(1 + |Du|²) ≤ Ae^(Cu) on M.

1/(X^(2) - 1) tr(A^(r)_X, 1_X) = 1/(|X^(2)|) Σ_(σ: σ') (A^(r)_X, 1_X)

= 1/(|X^(2)|) Σ_(σ: σ') (Φ_r(X; σ, σ') - Φ_(r-1)(X; σ, σ')).

Proof. The proof follows by induction on r. For r = 0, A^(0)_X = Id_X, and thus

(A^(0)_X 1_X, 1_X) = {1 σ = σ'
0 otherwise

On the other hand, from the definition of Φ_0, we have that

Φ_0(X; σ, σ') = {1 σ = σ'
0 otherwise

and thus

Φ_0(X; σ, σ') - Φ_(-1)(X; σ, σ') = {1 σ = σ'
-1 σ = σ'
0 otherwise

which proves the result for r = 0.

Turning to the induction step, assume the result holds for r and observe (A^(r+1)_X 1_X, 1_X). By definition (A^(r+1)_X 1_X, 1_X) = (A^(r)_X 1_X, 1_X) and since

A_X 1_σ(σ') = Σ_(ρ: σ') 1_ρ(σ') = {1 σ ~ σ'
-1 σ ~ σ'
0 otherwise

namely

A_X 1_σ = Σ_(σ: σ') 1_σ,

we conclude that

(A^(r+1)_X 1_X, 1_X) = (A^(r)_X (Σ_(σ: σ') 1_σ), 1_X) = Σ_(σ: σ') (A^(r)_X 1_σ, 1_X).

Thus by induction

(A^(r+1)_X 1_X, 1_X) = Σ_(σ: σ') (Φ_r(X; ρ, σ') - Φ_(r-1)(X; ρ, σ')) = Φ_(r+1)(X; σ, σ') - Φ_r(X; σ, σ'),

where in the last step we used the fact that any path of length r + 1 from σ to σ' is composed of one step from σ to a neighbour ρ of σ in G_d(X) followed by a path of length r from ρ to σ'.

The formula for (Φ_r(X; σ, σ')) follows from the fact that (1_σ)_σ∈X^(d-1) is an orthonormal basis for Q^(d-1)(X).

Simplicial Spanning Trees

Let G = (V, E) be a graph with vertex set V and edge set E and for a vertex v ∈ V, denote by deg(v) its degree. G is called a k-regular graph, if deg(v) = k for all v ∈ V. A sub-graph T = (V', E') of G is called a spanning tree of G if T is an acyclic, connected graph such that V' = V. For a graph G, denote by κ(G) the number of spanning trees in it.

A classical model for random k-regular graphs, called the random matching model G_(n,k), is defined for k ≥ 1 and n ∈ N even as the graph with vertex set [n] := {1, 2, ..., n} and edge set which is the union of k independent and uniformly distributed perfect matching on the set [n].

Weak convergence of the empirical spectral distributions

Definition 7.1. Let X be a d-dimensional simplicial complex. The oriented line-graph of X, denoted G_d(X) = (X^(d-1)_X, E_d(X)), is the graph whose vertex set X^(d-1)_X is composed of all oriented (d - 1) faces in X and its edge set E_d(X) is defined to be the set of pairs {σ, σ'} from X^(d-1)_X such that σ is a neighbour of σ' in X.

Proposition 7.1. Let X be a pure, d-complex such that deg(σ) < ∞ for all σ ∈ X^(d-1)_X. For r ≥ 0 and σ, σ' ∈ X^(d-1)_X denote by Φ_r(X; σ, σ') the number of paths of length r in G_d(X) from σ to σ'. Then

(A^(r+1)_X 1_X, 1_X) = Σ_(σ: σ') (Φ_r(X; ρ, σ') - Φ_(r-1)(X; ρ, σ')), ∀σ, σ' ∈ X^(d-1)_X.

In particular, for every choice of orientation X^(d-1)_X for each of the (d - 1) faces

The asymptotic number of simplicial spanning trees

Definition 7.2. Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are defined as the unique sequence of polynomials (T_n)_n∈N satisfying deg(T_n) = n for all n ∈ N and T_n cos(x) = cos(nx) for all n ∈ N.

Chebyshev's polynomials are classical and well studied, c.f. (42). Below we collect several useful properties they posses.

Orthogonality

∫-11 Tn(x)Tm(x)/√(1-x^2) dx = { 0 if n ≠ m, π if n, m = 0, π/2 if n = m ≠ 0. (7.37)

that
α(p) = γ(p)/A
β(p) = Bγ(p).

We can rewrite (4.23) as α(p) = γ(p)A = α(pq)A

Logarithmic generating function For all |r| < 1 and x ∈ R
log(1 - 2xr + r^2) = -2∑(Tn(x)r^n)/n. (7.38)

If B = 1, then, we obtain a right pseudoautomorphism α of L with companion A, which we'll denote by the pair (α, A), and which satisfies α(p)α(q)A = α(pq)A. (8.43)

Expansion of powers via Chebyshev's polynomials For every n ≥ 0
x^(2n+1) = 2^(1-2n)∑((2n+1)/(n-m))T_(2m+1)(x) (7.39)

We have the following useful relations for quotients:
α(q^(-1)p)A = α(q^(-1))α(p)A (8.44a)
α(p/q)α(q)A = α(p)A (8.44b)

and x^(2n) = 2^(1-2n)∑((2n)/(n-m))T_(2m)(x) + 2^(-2n)((2n)/n) (7.40)

There are several equivalent ways of characterizing right pseudoautomorphisms.

Hence for every converging power series
∑c_nx^n = ∑(∑((2n)/(n-m)))T_(2m)(x) + ∑(∑((2n+1)/(n-m)))T_(2m+1)(x) + ∑(∑((2n)/(n-m)))T_(2m)(x). (7.41)

Theorem 8.1. Let L be a loop and suppose α: L → L. Also, let A ∈ L and γ = R_Aα. Then the following are equivalent:
1. (α, A) is a right pseudoautomorphism of L with companion A.
2. (α, β, γ) is an autotopy of L with α(1) = 1 and β(1) = γ(1) = A.
3. γ(1) = A and γ satisfies γ(p)γ(qγ^(-1)(1)) = γ(pq). (8.45)

Let g: [-1, 1] → R be a continuous function. Denoting h(x) = g(x)/√(1-x^2), the orthogonality property (7.37) with respect to the function (1-x^2)^(-1/2), enables us to develop h as a power series in Chebyshev polynomials h(x) = ∑α_nT_n(x).

Remark 8.2. Similarly, if A = 1, then we can rewrite (4.23) as Bβ(p)β(q) = Bβ(pq)

where α_n is given by α_n = { 1/π ∫-11 T_0(x)g(x)dx if n = 0, 2/π ∫-11 T_n(x)g(x)dx if n ≥ 1.

and in this case, β is a left pseudoautomorphism with companion B. Finally, suppose C = 1, so that then A = B^q, and we can rewrite (4.23) γ(p)/B = Bβ(q) = γ(pq)

In particular, if the Chebyshev power series of h converges uniformly on (-1, 1) we get from (7.38) and integration term by term that ∫-11 log(1 - 2xr + r^2)g(x)dx = ∫-11 (-2∑(T_n(x)r^n)/n)g(x)dx = -2∑(r^n/n)∫-11 (T_n(x)h(x))/√(1-x^2) dx = -π∑(α_nr^n)/n. (7.42)

so that in this case, γ is a middle pseudoautomorphism with companion B.

Example 8.3. In a Moufang loop, consider the map Ad_q, given by p → qpq^(-1). Note that this can be written unambiguously due to diassociativity. Then, this is a right pseudoautomorphism with companion q^2 (28. Lemma 1.2). Indeed, using diassociativity for {q, xy}, we have q(xy)qq^(-1) = q(xy)q^2.

Pseudoautomorphisms

On the other hand, qxq^(-1)qq^(-1) = q(xq^(-1)⋅(qyq))q = (q(xq^(-1)⋅q)yq)q = (q(xy⋅q))q = q(xy)q^2.

Suppose now L is a loop and (α, β, γ) is an autotopy of L. Let B = α(1), A = β(1), C = γ(1). It is clear that BA = C. Moreover, from (4.23) we see

where we have use appropriate Moufang identities. Hence, indeed, q(xy)qq^(-2) = (qxq^(-1)⋅q)(qyq^(-1)⋅q^2).

In general, the adjoint map on a loop is not a pseudoautomorphism or a loop homomorphism. For each q ∈ L, Ad_q is just a bijection that preserves 1 ∈ L.

However, as we see above, it is a pseudoautomorphism if the loop is Moufang. Keeping the same terminology as for groups, we'll say that Ad defines an adjoint action of L on itself, although for a non-associative loop, this is not an action in the usual sense of a group action.

We can easily see that the right pseudoautomorphisms of L form a group under composition. Denote this group by PsAut (1). Clearly, Aut (1) C PsAut (L). Similarly for left and middle pseudoautomorphisms. More precisely, a C PsAut (L) if there exists ACL such that (8.43) holds. Here we are not fixing the companion. On the other hand, consider the set (1) of all pairs (e. A) of right psexdooutomorphisms with fixed companions. This then also forms a group.

Lemma 8.4. The set PR (1) of oll pairs (a, A), where a ∈ PsAut" (L) and AEL is its companion, is a group with identity element (id, 1) and the following group operations:

product: (A) (42) (αοαα (4) Α₁) (8.46a)
inverse: (α. Α) = (α.α (A)) = (a, (α(A))) (8.46b)

Proof. Indeed, it is casy to see that a, (A) A is a companion of a, a, that (8.46a) is associative, and that (id. 1) is the identity element with respect to it. Also, it is easy to see that

(α, Α) (α,α (Α)) (id, 1)

On the other hand, setting Ba (A^), we have

B a (1) Ba (AA) B
(A) (A) B
Βα (Α) Β.

Cancelling A on both sides on the left, we see that B = (a (A))
Let C (L) be the set of elements of that are a companion for a right pseudoautomorphism. Then, (8.46a) shows that there is a left action of " (L) on C" (L) given by:

PR (L) x CR (L) CR (L)
((a, A), B) (a. A) B = a (B) A. (8.47a)
(8.47b)

This action is transitive, because if A. B C (L), then exist a. PsAut (L), such that (a. A), (0, B) PR (1), and hence ((β, Β) (α, Α)) B. Similarly, (L) also acts on all of L. Let h (2,A) (L), then for any pe L. h (p) = a (p) A. This is in general non-transitive, but a faithful action (assuming 1 is non-trivial). Using this, the definition of (8.431 can be rewrillen as

h(pq)=a(p) h(g) (8.48)

and hence the quotient relations (8.44) may be rewritten as

h(q\p) a (g)\h (p) (8.49a)
a (p/q) h(p)/h(g). (8.496)

If (L) acts transitively on L, then C (L) L, since every element of L will be a companion for some right pseudoautomorphism. In that case, I is know as a (right) G-loup. Note that usually a loop is known as a G-loop is every

element of L is a companion for a right pseudoautornorphism and for a left pseudoautomorphism (36). However, in this paper we will only be concerned. with right pseudoautomorphisms, so for brevity we will say L is a G-loop if PR (1) acts transitively on it.

There is another action of PR (1) on 1 which is the action by the pseudoautomorphism. This is a non-faithful action of 4" (L), but corresponds to a faithful action of PsAut (1). Nanely, let h(a, 4) € Ψ (1), then h acts on peL by pa (p). To distinguish these two actions, we make the following definitions.

Definition 8.5. Let be a loop and les (1) the group of riglu pseudoautomorphism pairs. 1 admits two left actions of " (L) on itself. Let h(a. A) C4 (L) and p CL

1. The full action is given by (hp) h(p) = a (p) A. The set L together with this action of (L) will be denoted by L
2. The partial action, given by (h.p) h' (p) = a (p). The set L together with this action of (1) will be denoted by again.

Remark 8.6. From (8.48), these definitions suggest that the loop product on I can be regarded as a map xi. This bears some similarity to Clifford product structure on spirors, hunwever without the lineur structure, but instead with the constraint that Land Lare identical as sets. This however allows to define left and right division.

Now let us consider several relationships between the different groups associated to. First of all define the following maps:

11 Aut (1) (1) (8.50)
(71)

and

C : (1)" (L) (8.51)
(id, C),

The map is clearly injective and is a group homomorphism, so 2, (Aut (L)) is a subgroup of P (L). On the other hand, if A, BEN (L), then in " (L), (id, A) (id, B) (id, BA), so t is an antihomomorphism from N'" (L) to PR (1) and thus a homomorphism from the opposite group A (Ly". So, (N (L)) is a subgroup of PR (L) that is isomorphic to N' (L)
Using (8.50) let us define a right action of Aut (L) on W (L). Given 7 Aut (1) and (4, 4) ∈ (1), we deline

(α. Α) - γ = (α, 4), (γ) = (αογ, 1). (8.52)

Similarly. (8.51) allows to define a left action of N" (L), and hence a right action of "" (L), on PR (L):

C-(a. A) = 12 (C) (a. A) = (a, AC). (8.53)

The actions (8.52) and (8.53) commule, we can combine them to deline a left action of Aut (L) x A (L). Indeed, given y e Aut (L) and CE N'R (L),

(α. Α)-(y. C) = 1 (C) (4. A) (2) = (αογ. ΑC). (8.54)

Remark 8.7. Since any element of NR (1) is right companion for any aatsmorphixon, also define the semi-direct product subgroup

(Aut(L)) (N^R (L)) ⊂ Ψ^R (L). Suppose β, γ ∈ Aut (L) and B, C ∈ N^R (L), then in this semi-direct product,

(β, B)(γ, C) = (β∘γ, B(C)B).

Lemma 8.8. Given the actions of Aut (L) and N^R (L) on Ψ^R (L) as in (8.52) and (8.53), respectively, we have the following properties.

1. Ψ^R (L)/Aut (L) ≅ C^R (L) as Ψ^R (L)-sets.
2. The image ι_2(N^R (L)) is a normal subgroup of Ψ^R (L) and hence Ψ^R (L)/N^R (L) ⊵ PsAut^R (L).
3. Moreover, Ψ^R (L)/Aut (L) × N^R (L) Ψ^R (L) ≅ PsAut^R (L)/Aut (L) ≅ C^R (L)/N^R (L) where equivalence is as Aut (L) × N^R (L)-sets.

Proof. Suppose L is a loop.

1. Consider the projection on the second component prj_2 : Ψ^R (L) → C^R (L) under which (α, A) ↦ A. Both Ψ^R (L) and C^R (L) are left Ψ^R (L)-sets, since both admit a left Ψ^R (L) action - Ψ^R (L) acts on itself by left multiplication and acts on C^R (L) via the action (8.47). Hence, prj_2 is a Ψ^R (L)-equivariant map (i.e. a G-set homomorphism). On the other hand, given the action (8.52) of Aut (L) on Ψ^R (L), we easily see that two pseudoautomorphisms have the same companion if and only if they lie in the same orbit of Aut (L). Thus, prj_2 descends to a Ψ^R (L)-equivariant bijection Ψ^R (L)/Aut (L) → C^R (L), so that Ψ^R (L)/Aut (L) ≅ C^R (L) as Ψ^R (L)-sets.

2. It is clear that C ∈ C^R (L) is a right companion of the identity map id if and only if C ∈ N^R (L). Now, let v = (id, C) ∈ ι_2(N^R (L)) and g = (α, A) ∈ Ψ^R (L). Then,

gvg^(-1) = (α, A)(id, C)(α^(-1), A^(-1)) = (id, A^α(C)A). (8.55)

In particular, this shows that gvg^(-1) ∈ ι_2(N^R (L)) since A^α(C)A is the right companion of id. Thus indeed, ι_2(N^R (L)) is a normal subgroup of Ψ^R (L). Now consider the projection on the first component prj_1 : Ψ^R (L) → PsAut^R (L) under which (α, A) ↦ α. This is clearly a group homomorphism with kernel ι_2(N^R (L)). Thus, R(Ψ^R (L)) ≅ Ψ^R (L)/N^R (L) ⊵ PsAut^R (L).

3. Since the actions of N^R (L) and Aut (L) on Ψ^R (L) commute, the action of Aut (L) descends to N^R (L) \ Ψ^R (L) ⊵ PsAut^R (L) and the action of N^R (L) \ Ψ^R (L) descends to Ψ^R (L)/Aut (L) ≅ C^R (L). Since the left action of N^R (L) on Ψ^R (L) corresponds to an action by right multiplication on C^R (L), we find that there is a bijection PsAut^R (L)/Aut (L) → C^R (L)/N^R (L).

Suppose (α, A) ∈ Ψ^R (L) and let [α]_Aut(L) ∈ PsAut^R (L)/Aut (L) be the orbit of α under the action of Aut (L) and let [A]_N^R(L) ∈ C^R (L)/N^R (L) be the orbit of A under the action of N^R (L). Then the bijection is given by [α]_Aut(L) ↦ [A]_N^R(L). Moreover, each of these orbits also corresponds to the orbit of (α, A) under the right action of Aut (L) × N^R (L) on Ψ^R (L). These quotients preserve actions of Aut (L) × N^R (L) on corresponding sets and thus these coset spaces are equivalent as Aut (L) × N^R (L)-sets.

The above relationships between the different groups are summarized in Figure 2.

Conclusion

In this paper, we try to combine partial differential equations with algebraic geometry and other content through YH-DIE (also see (48)). In order to achieve this ambition, we tried to study from the perspectives of Algebraic Geometry, Differential Geometry and Analysis of PDEs. YH-DIE is still a relatively young research object in mathematics, and we hope that more mathematician will participate and develop it into a mature branch.
