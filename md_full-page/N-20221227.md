INFORMAL NOTES ON
MATHEMATICS
2022.12.27
Category Theory (Continued)
1.2.4. Example: abelian groups. The abelian groups, along with group homomorphisms, form a category Ab.

1.2.5. Important Example: Modules over a ring. If A is a ring, then the A-modules form a category ModA. (This category has additional structure; it will be the prototypical example of an abelian category, see §1.6.) Taking A = k, we obtain Example 1.2.3; taking A = Z, we obtain Example 1.2.4.

1.2.6. Example: rings. There is a category Rings, where the objects are rings, and the morphisms are maps of rings in the usual sense (maps of sets which respect addition and multiplication, and which send 1 to 1 by our conventions, §0.3).

1.2.7. Example: topological spaces. The topological spaces, along with continuous maps, form a category Top. The isomorphisms are homeomorphisms.

1.2.8. Example: partially ordered sets. A partially ordered set, (or poset), is a set S along with a binary relation ≥ on S satisfying:
(i) x ≥ x (reflexivity),
(ii) x ≥ y and y ≥ z imply x ≥ z (transitivity), and
(iii) if x ≥ y and y ≥ x then x = y (antisymmetry).

A partially ordered set (S, ≥) can be interpreted as a category whose objects are the elements of S, and with a single morphism from x to y if and only if x ≥ y (and no morphism otherwise).

A trivial example is (S,≥) where x ≥ y if and only if x = y. Another example is
(1.2.8.1)

Here there are three objects. The identity morphisms are omitted for convenience, and the two non-identity morphisms are depicted. A third example is
(1.2.8.2)

Here the "obvious" morphisms are again omitted: the identity morphisms, and the morphism from the upper left to the lower right. Similarly,

depicts a partially ordered set, where again, only the "generating morphisms" are depicted.

1.2.9. Example: the category of subsets of a set, and the category of open subsets of a topological space. If X is a set, then the subsets form a partially ordered set, where the order is given by inclusion. Informally, if U ⊂ V, then we have exactly one morphism U → V in the category (and otherwise none). Similarly, if X is a topological space, then the open sets form a partially ordered set, where the order is given by inclusion.

1.2.10. Definition. A subcategory A of a category B has as its objects some of the objects of B, and some of the morphisms, such that the morphisms of A include the identity morphisms of the objects of A, and are closed under composition. (For example, (1.2.8.1) is in an obvious way a subcategory of (1.2.8.2). Also, we have an obvious "inclusion functor" i: A → B.)

Definition 1.2. A functor

F: C → D

between categories C and D is a mapping of objects to objects and arrows to arrows, in such a way that
(a) F(f: A → B) = F(f): F(A) → F(B),
(b) F(1A) = 1F(A);
(c) F(g ◦ f) = F(g) ◦ F(f).

That is, F preserves domains and codomains, identity arrows, and composition. A functor F: C → D thus gives a sort of "picture"—perhaps distorted—of C in D.

1.2.12. Example: a forgetful functor. Consider the functor from the category of vector spaces (over a field k) Veck to Sets, that associates to each vector space its underlying set. The functor sends a linear transformation to its underlying map of sets. This is an example of a forgetful functor, where some additional structure is forgotten. Another example of a forgetful functor is ModA → Ab from A-modules to abelian groups, remembering only the abelian group structure of the A-module.

1.2.13. Topological examples. Examples of covariant functors include the fundamental group functor π₁, which sends a topological space X with choice of a point x₀ ∈ X to a group π₁(X, x₀) (what are the objects and morphisms of the source category?), and the ith homology functor Top → Ab, which sends a topological space X to its ith homology group Hᵢ(X, Z). The covariance corresponds to the fact that a (continuous) morphism of pointed topological spaces Φ: X → Y with Φ(x₀) = y₀ induces a map of fundamental groups π₁(X, x₀) → π₁(Y, y₀), and similarly for homology groups.

43, Лайдаулаилэ, 我们来(好好ublян)看一点代拓

§57.1 Spheres

Recall that

Sⁿ = {(x₀,...,xₙ) | x₀² + ... + xₙ² = 1} ⊂ ℝⁿ⁺¹

is the surface of an n-sphere while

Dⁿ⁺¹ = {(x₀,...,xₙ) | x₀² + ... + xₙ² ≤ 1} ⊂ ℝⁿ⁺¹

is the corresponding closed ball (So for example, D² is a disk in a plane while S¹ is the unit circle.)

Exercise 57.1.1. Show that the open ball Dⁿ \ Sⁿ⁻¹ is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ.

In particular, S⁰ consists of two points, while D¹ can be thought of as the interval [-1,1].

啊,稍等,我们点拓看得太少了,很多概念还没拓展到Top Space上,ertto homeomorphic.
考虑以下问题:

X = {a, b, c, d, e}, Y = {g, h, i, j, k},

τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c,d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, c}},

和

T₁ = {Y, Ø, {g}, {i, j}, {g, i, j}, {h, i, j, k}}.

显然直觉上(X,T)“等价于”(Y,₁).由f(a) = g, f(a) = g, f(a) = g, f(a) =
g. f(a) = g定义的映射f:X→Y提供了等价性,我们现在正式化这种等价
性.

定义 4.2.1.令(X,T)和(Y,T₁)为拓扑空间,则它们称为同胚的,如果存在满
足下列性质的映射f:X→Y:

(i) f是一一的(即由f(x1)=f(x2) 有X1=X2成立),

(ii) f是到上的(即对任何y∈Y,存在x∈X使得f(x) = y),

(iii)对每个U∈1, f⁻¹(U) ∈T,且

(iv)对每个V∈τ, f(V) ∈τι.

进一步,映射称为(X,T)和(Y,T₁)之间的一个同胚映射,我们记为(X,T)
(Υ, τι).

我们将要证出“≅”是一个等价关系,并用这一点证明所有开区间(a,b)彼
此间是同胚的,例4.2.2是第一步,它表明了“≅”是一个传递关系.

例4.2.2.令(X,T), (Y, T₁)和(Z,T2)为拓扑空间,如果(X,T)≅(Y,T₁)且(Υ, τι)≅
(Z,T2),求证(X,T) ≅ (Z, T2).

证明.

由于(X,T)≅(Y,τι) 且(Υ, τι) ≅ (Z,72),存在同胚映射ƒ:(X,T) →
(Y,₁)和g: (Y, T₁)→(2,72).考虑符合映射gof:X→Z. [这里gof(x) =
g(f(x)),对所有x ∈ X.] 验证gof是一一的及到上的是程序性任务,现在
设U∈ 72. 则由于为同胚映射,g⁻¹(U)∈₁.由f是同胚映射的事实,我们得
到f⁻¹(g⁻¹(U)) ∈т.但f⁻¹(g⁻¹(U)) = (gof)⁻¹(U). 所以gof有定义4.2.1的
性质(iii).接下来令Ver.那么∫(V) ∈1, 故g(f(V)) ∈72; 即g∫(V) ∈ 72,
于是我们看到g。f有定义4.2.1的性质(iv).因此gof是同胚映射.

例 4.2.5.求证空间ℝ与具有通常拓扑的开区间(-1,1)同胚

证明.

(简略证明.)定义f:(-1,1)→R,

f(x) = x/(1-|x|)

容易验证f是——一并到上的,类似于例4.2.4中的图示推导表明f是一个同胚拓扑.

用同样的思路,令f=(x1,x2,...,xn)→(x1/(1-|x1|), x2/(1-|x2|),...),易知f为Dn/Sn-1到Rn的同胚

§57.2 Quotient topology

Prototypical example for this section: Dn/Sn-1 = Sn, or the torus.

Given a space X, we can identify some of the points together by any equivalence relation ~; for an x ∈ X we denote its equivalence class by [x]. Geometrically, this is the space achieved by welding together points equivalent under ~.
Formally,

Definition 57.2.1. Let X be a topological space, and ~ an equivalence relation on the points of X. Then X/~ is the space whose

*   Points are equivalence classes of X, and

*   U ⊂ X/~ is open if and only if {x ∈ X such that [x] ∈ U} is open in X.

As far as I can tell, this definition is mostly useless for intuition, so here are some examples.

明天继续。
