Some Complex Analysis as well

In the ten analysis, we can always encounter some functions that make us very uncomfortable. For example:
(a) The Devil's Staircase (or Cantor function) is a continuous function
H: [0,1] -> [0,1] which has derivative zero "almost everywhere", yet H(0) = 0 and H(1) = 1.
(b) The Weierstraß function

x -> Σ (1/2)^n cos(114514^n πx)

is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.
(c) The function

x -> { x^100, x >= 0
       -x^100, x < 0

has the first 99 derivatives but not the 100th one.
(d) If a function has all derivatives (we call these smooth functions), then it has a Taylor series. But for real functions that Taylor series might still be wrong. The function

x -> { e^(-1/x), x > 0
       0, x <= 0

has derivatives at every point. But if you expand the Taylor series at x = 0, you get 0 = 0x + 0x^2 + ..., which is wrong for any x > 0 (even x = 0.0001).

We restrict our attention to differentiable functions called holomorphic functions. It turns out that the multiplication on C makes all the difference. Opposite the real functions, knowing tiny amounts of data about the function can determine all its values.

Definition 1
Let f: U -> C be a complex function. Then for some z_0 ∈ U, we define the derivative at z_0 to be

lim (h->0) (f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)) / h

Note that this limit may not exist; when it does we say f is differentiable at z_0.

好我们来看一些需要注意的地方。从定义上看这和我们在实分析里学的微分定义一模一样,
因此我们可以猜想这个“复”极限就是指对于每个ε>0,有一个δ>0便得

0 < |h| < δ ⇒ |(f(z₀ + h) - f(z₀))/h - L| < ε

但是注意到这时候这个邻域已经不是直线上的一段区间了，而是一个圆。这部分可参见点集拓扑。在处理实极限时，我们要让左极限和右极限同时趋于 x₀，可以理解成从直线两端向中间某点趋近，但是复平面内不同；它要求从各个方向。这里简单画一个示意图。

Example 31.2.1 (Important: conjugation is not holomorphic)
Let f(z) = z̄ be complex conjugation, f: ℂ → ℂ. This function, despite its simple nature, is not holomorphic! Indeed, at z = 0 we have,

(f(h) - f(0))/h = h̄/h.

This does not have a limit as h → 0, because depending on "which direction" we approach zero from we have different values.

f(z) = z̄
(f(0 + h) - f(0))/h

Definition 2
If a function f: U -> C is complex differentiable at all the points in its domain it is called holomorphic. In the special case of a holomorphic function with domain U = C, we call the function entire.

In all the examples below, the derivative of the function is the same as in their real analogues (e.g. the derivative of e^z is e^z).

(a) Any polynomial z -> z^n + c_{n-1}z^{n-1} + ... + c_0 is holomorphic.

(b) The complex exponential exp: x + yi -> e^x(cos y + i sin y) can be shown to be holomorphic.

(c) sin and cos are holomorphic when extended to the complex plane by
cos z = (e^{iz} + e^{-iz})/2 and sin z = (e^{iz} - e^{-iz})/2i.

(d) As usual, the sum, product, chain rules and so on apply, and hence sums, products, nonzero quotients, and compositions of holomorphic functions are also holomorphic.
