A Comprehensive Note on Transformations in Conic
Sections
and Their Connection to the Erlangen Program

1 Affine Transformations
In this section, I delve into the nature of affine transformations. An affine transformation can be thought of as a map

T: ℝⁿ → ℝⁿ

that preserves points, straight lines, and planes. More precisely, an affine map has the form

T(x) = Ax + b,

where A is an n x n matrix and b ∈ ℝⁿ is a translation vector. I find it fascinating that while the linear part A accounts for rotations, scalings, shearings, and reflections, the translation b simply "slides" the entire space.

1.1 Definition and Fundamental Properties
Let me begin with the rigorous definition: An affine transformation is a function T: ℝⁿ → ℝⁿ of the form

T(x) = Ax + b,

with A ∈ GL(n, ℝ) if we restrict ourselves to invertible maps (though in a more general sense, A can be any n x n matrix). The essential properties include:

*   Collinearity Preservation: Any three collinear points remain collinear after the transformation.

*   Ratio Preservation: The ratios of distances along any line (i.e., the division ratio) are preserved.

*   Parallelism: Parallel lines remain parallel under any affine transformation.

I note that these properties are central to the geometry of affine spaces. I find it particularly interesting that while distances and angles are generally not preserved under affine transformations, the concept of affine combinations is preserved.

means if I have points x₁, x₂, ..., xₖ and real numbers λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₖ with Σλᵢ = 1, then

T(Σλᵢxᵢ) = ΣλᵢT(xᵢ).

This property is absolutely fundamental when I think about affine spaces because it encapsulates the idea that the structure of the space is "affine" rather than metric.

1.2 Examples and Applications

Let me illustrate with a few examples:

(a) Translation: Here, A is the identity matrix I and b is a nonzero vector. In this case, T(x) = x + b. I find translations to be the simplest type of affine transformation: they do not alter the shape or orientation of figures.

(b) Linear Transformation: If b = 0, the affine transformation reduces to a linear map T(x) = Ax. Depending on the choice of A, the transformation may rotate, scale, or shear the space.

(c) Combined Transformations: More interesting is the combination of a linear transformation with a translation. For instance, if A is a rotation matrix and b is nonzero, then T rotates the figure about the origin and then translates it.

I must mention that while exploring these examples, I often liken an affine transformation to a "recipe" where the ingredients (scaling, rotating, shearing, and translating) are mixed together to produce a final dish that retains certain geometric flavors (collinearity, parallelism) but may lose others (distances, angles).

1.3 Affine Invariants and Their Role in Conic Sections

An important concept in affine geometry is that of invariants - quantities or properties that remain unchanged under an affine transformation. For instance, the affine ratio (the ratio of lengths along a line) is an invariant. More subtly, the notion of parallelism is invariant under any affine map. When I study conic sections, these invariants help me classify curves up to affine equivalence. A particularly interesting point is that although ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas are all conic sections, they are not necessarily affinely equivalent. For example, any nondegenerate ellipse can be transformed by an affine transformation into a circle. However, the same is not true for hyperbolas. This discrepancy is a rich source of inquiry.

Let me illustrate with a concrete example. Suppose I have an ellipse given by the equation

x²/a² + y²/b² = 1.

Under a suitable affine transformation, I can map this ellipse to a circle. One standard approach is to perform a scaling transformation that normalizes the different coefficients. If I set u = x/a and v = y/b, then the ellipse becomes

u² + v² = 1.

which is exactly the unit circle. I must note that this transformation is not an isometry (it does not preserve distances), but it is affine, as it preserves the affine structure (e.g., the ratio of areas, collinearity, etc.). I suddenly thought that this example is a wonderful demonstration of how seemingly different curves can be unified under the umbrella of affine geometry. I guess this is one of the many reasons why affine invariants are so important.

1.4 A Few Technical Observations

I now pause to remark on a technical point: In the context of projective geometry (which will be discussed in detail later), affine transformations can be viewed as restrictions of projective transformations that preserve the hyperplane at infinity. This connection provides a conceptual bridge between affine and projective theories. I find it intellectually stimulating to observe that what is lost (or added) in moving from affine to projective geometry is precisely the treatment of the infinite "points" or directions. For the moment, I shall reserve a more thorough discussion of this interplay until the projective geometry section.

2 Projective Geometry

Projective geometry represents a fascinating leap from the familiar Euclidean and affine realms. In projective space, we extend the concept of the usual R" by adjoining "points at infinity" in such a way that every pair of distinct lines meets in a unique point. This framework eliminates the exception of parallel lines and allows for a more uniform treatment of geometric phenomena.

2.1 Basic Definitions and Concepts

The standard way to introduce projective geometry is to define the projective space IP as the set of lines through the origin in R+1. That is, a point in IP is an equivalence class [x0:x1:...:xn], where (x0, x1,..., xn) ≠ 0 and two tuples represent the same point if they differ by a nonzero scalar multiple.

A key advantage of this perspective is that it allows one to treat parallel lines as intersecting at a point at infinity. For example, in the projective plane F2, all lines parallel in the affine sense will meet at a common point on the line at infinity. I sometimes like to imagine the projective plane as a kind of "completed" version of the affine plane, where nothing is left out, not even the "directions" in which lines extend infinitely.

2.2 Homogeneous Coordinates and Transformations

The coordinates [x:y:z] used in P2 are known as homogeneous coordinates. They have the nice property that the equations of conic sections (and indeed, of many geometric objects) become homogeneous. For instance, a general conic section in the

projective plane is given by
Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dxz + Eyz + Fz² = 0,

where not all of A, B, C, D, E, F are zero. In the affine patch z ≠ 0, setting x = u and y = v with z = 1 recovers the standard quadratic equation in u and v.

The most general transformation in projective geometry is the projective transformation or homography. It is given by an invertible 3 x 3 matrix acting on homogeneous coordinates:

(x') = (a11 a12 a13)(x)
(y') = (a21 a22 a23)(y)
(z') = (a31 a32 a33)(z)

I must mention that projective transformations preserve the cross-ratio, a classical invariant in projective geometry. The cross-ratio of four collinear points (P,Q; R, S) is defined as

(P, Q; R, S) = PR·QS / QR·PS

with the appropriate directed distance interpretations. I find the invariance of the cross-ratio extremely fascinating - it is one of those rare gems in mathematics that provides a deep connection between seemingly unrelated configurations.

2.3 Projective Duality and Conics

One of the most powerful ideas in projective geometry is the concept of duality. In the projective plane, points and lines can often be interchanged in statements without altering the truth of the statement. In particular, a conic section can be defined either as the locus of points satisfying a quadratic equation or as the envelope of a family of lines.

I recall an interesting discussion on MathStackExchange where someone asked about the dual conic of a given conic, and the answer elegantly showed that if the conic is non-degenerate, its dual is also a non-degenerate conic. This is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practically useful when dealing with problems that involve tangency conditions.

2.4 The Interplay Between Affine and Projective Geometries

It is illuminating to see how affine geometry sits inside projective geometry. In fact, if we remove the line at infinity from the projective plane, we recover the affine plane. The affine transformations are exactly those projective transformations that preserve the line at infinity. I find this correspondence to be a perfect example of how extending our perspective (from affine to projective) can simplify and unify many aspects of geometry.

I suddenly thought that this interplay provides a wonderful philosophical lesson: by adding "points at infinity," we sometimes gain a simpler and more symmetric theory. I guess this is analogous to how, in other areas of mathematics, extending the number system (e.g., from real to complex numbers) often leads to more elegant results.

3 Inversion Transformations

Inversion is a transformation that has always intrigued me because of its counterintuitive nature. At first glance, the inversion with respect to a circle seems to distort the plane in a very non-linear way. Yet, it preserves circles and angles, which is quite remarkable.

3.1 Definition of Inversion

Let C be a circle in the plane with center O and radius R. The inversion with respect to C is defined as the map that sends any point P (different from O) to a point P' lying on the ray OP such that

|OP| * |OP'| = R².

In other words, if I denote by r = |OP|, then the image P' is located at a distance r' = R²/r from O. I note that the center O is a fixed singular point for the inversion; it does not have an image in the usual sense.

3.2 Geometric Properties and Intuition

Inversion has several surprising properties:

*   It sends circles not passing through O to other circles.

*   It sends circles passing through O to lines (which can be thought of as circles passing through the point at infinity).

*   It preserves angles between curves (up to orientation), making it a conformal map.

I often think of inversion as a kind of "mathematical mirror" that flips the inside and the outside of the circle while preserving the overall structure of the figures. When I first encountered this concept, I was puzzled by the idea that a circle could turn into a line. However, after spending time exploring various examples, I realized that the key is to consider the extended plane where lines are regarded as circles through infinity. This viewpoint makes the concept much more natural.

3.3 Algebraic Formulation

In Cartesian coordinates, suppose the circle of inversion has center at the origin for simplicity, and radius R. Then the inversion of a point (x, y) is given by:

(x, y) -> (R²x/(x²+y²), R²y/(x²+y²)).

I must admit that when I first derived this formula, I struggled with the algebra, but eventually I understood that it is a direct consequence of the condition |OP|.

---

## 第 6 页

|OP'| = R². I suddenly thought that there is an analogy between this formula and the reciprocal function on the real numbers. In a sense, inversion "inverts" the distance from the origin, a fact that I find conceptually pleasing.

3.4 Inversion and Conic Sections

The interplay between inversion and conic sections is one of the most interesting aspects of this transformation. Consider a conic section such as a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola. Under an inversion, a circle that does not pass through the center of inversion is mapped to another circle. However, a line (viewed as a degenerate circle through infinity) is mapped to a circle passing through the center of inversion. I suddenly thought that this property can be exploited to study the properties of conics by "moving" the center of inversion appropriately.

For example, let me consider a parabola. Although a parabola is not a circle, by choosing a suitable circle of inversion, I can map the parabola to a circle. This technique is sometimes used to prove results that are more easily stated for circles. I guess that, in some cases, inversion can serve as a bridge between problems in Euclidean geometry and those in the realm of circle geometry. However, I must caution that not every property is preserved under inversion while angles are preserved, distances and areas are not. Thus, any conclusions drawn from an inversion must be carefully translated back to the original setting.

3.5 A Brief Discussion on the Conformal Nature

Since inversion is conformal (angle-preserving), it plays a significant role in complex analysis as well. In fact, inversion is one of the basic Möbius transformations when extended to the complex plane. I suddenly thought that this connection is deep: the same transformation that helps in studying conic sections also plays a crucial role in the theory of analytic functions. I guess this is one of the many instances where different branches of mathematics reveal hidden connections through common structures.

4 Additional Transformations

To further enrich our discussion, I now introduce several additional transformations that frequently appear in geometry. While affine, projective, and inversion transformations are the main actors, other types such as Euclidean, similarity, and Möbius transformations also play important roles in both classical and modern geometry.

4.1 Euclidean Transformations

Euclidean transformations are the rigid motions of the Euclidean space they preserve distances and angles. The most common examples include:

(a) Translations: As already discussed, these shift every point by the same vector.

---

## 第 7 页

(b) Rotations: Rotations about a fixed point preserve the distances from that point.
(c) Reflections: These are isometries that flip the space over a line (in the plane) or a plane (in space).

I must emphasize that Euclidean transformations form a group, denoted by E(n), which is a subgroup of the affine group. I find it helpful to think of the Euclidean group as the collection of all "shape-preserving" operations. Because these transformations are isometries, they are often used in the study of conic sections when the metric properties (such as distances and angles) are of primary interest.

4.2 Similarity Transformations

A similarity transformation is an operation that preserves shapes but not necessarily sizes. In other words, it is composed of an Euclidean transformation (which preserves distances) followed by a uniform scaling. The general form of a similarity transformation in R" is:

T(x) = λAx + b,

where λ ≠ 0 is a scalar, A is an orthogonal matrix, and b is a translation vector. I find similarities very intuitive: they allow me to "zoom in" or "zoom out" of a figure while keeping its overall geometry intact. When studying conics, similarities are particularly useful for classifying conics up to shape, ignoring scale.

4.3 Möbius Transformations

Möbius transformations (or fractional linear transformations) are the most general conformal maps on the extended complex plane. A Möbius transformation is given by:

f(z) = (az + b) / (cz - d), ad - bc ≠ 0.

I must confess that when I first encountered Möbius transformations, I was both amazed and slightly intimidated by their complexity. However, with time I came to appreciate that these transformations are, in a sense, the projective transformations of the complex plane. They map circles and lines to circles and lines, and preserve the cross-ratio. This makes them a powerful tool in both complex analysis and geometry.

It is worth noting that Möbius transformations form a group, often denoted by PSL(2, C). This group can be thought of as a complexification of the real projective transformations. I suddenly thought that the deep interplay between geometry and complex analysis is encapsulated beautifully in the theory of Möbius transformations. I guess that studying them not only broadens one's perspective on geometric transformations but also provides a bridge to other fields, such as hyperbolic geometry and dynamical systems.

4.4 Interrelations and Hierarchies of Transformations

It is instructive to note how these various transformation groups relate to one another:

---

## 第 8 页

• Euclidean transformations are a subgroup of similarity transformations.
• Similarity transformations are a subgroup of affine transformations.
• Affine transformations are, in turn, a subgroup of projective transformations (those that preserve the line at infinity).
• Möbius transformations can be seen as projective transformations on the Riemann sphere.

I find it extremely elegant that there is a hierarchy among these groups. This hierarchy not only provides a structured way of classifying geometric transformations but also offers insight into which properties are preserved and which are not at each level. For instance, while angles are preserved by Euclidean and Möbius transformations, they are not generally preserved by affine transformations.

5 Conic Sections and Their Transformations

Conic sections, namely ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, have been studied for millennia. Their fascinating properties become even richer when one considers the effect of various transformations on them. In this section, I will explore how affine, projective, inversion, and other transformations affect conic sections.

5.1 The Classical Definitions of Conic Sections

A conic section is classically defined as the intersection of a plane with a double-napped cone. Depending on the angle at which the plane intersects the cone, we obtain different types of curves:

• Ellipse: The intersection is a closed, symmetric curve.
• Parabola: The intersection is an open curve that is symmetric about its axis.
• Hyperbola: The intersection consists of two disconnected curves (branches).

In analytic geometry, a conic can be represented by a general quadratic equation in two variables:
Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0,
with the discriminant Δ = B² - 4AC determining the type of conic:

• If Δ < 0, the conic is an ellipse (or a circle, as a special case).
• If Δ = 0, the conic is a parabola.
• If Δ > 0, the conic is a hyperbola.

I sometimes marvel at how a simple quadratic equation can capture such a diverse range of geometric shapes. It is a testament to the unifying power of algebra in geometry.

5.2 Effects of Affine Transformations on Conics
Under an affine transformation, a conic section remains a conic section. However, the specific type of conic may change. For example, any ellipse (provided it is nondegenerate) can be mapped to a circle via an appropriate affine transformation. In my explorations, I have found that while the affine type of the conic (i.e., whether it is nondegenerate) is preserved, the metric properties (such as eccentricity) are generally not.

Consider an ellipse given by
x²/a² + y²/b² = 1.

An affine transformation of the form
u = x/a, v = y/b,

maps the ellipse to the unit circle
u² + v² = 1.

However, this transformation distorts distances and angles. I suddenly thought that this phenomenon is an excellent demonstration of the idea that shape in an affine sense is a more robust notion than metric shape. I guess that this is one of the reasons why affine geometry is so appealing in contexts where one wants to disregard the notion of distance and focus purely on the incidence structure.

5.3 Projective Transformations and Conic Sections
Projective transformations, being more general than affine transformations, allow for even greater flexibility. In the projective plane, every nondegenerate conic is projectively equivalent to any other nondegenerate conic. That is, given any two conics C₁ and C₂, there exists a projective transformation P such that
P(C₁) = C₂.

I must admit that this result struck me as both beautiful and profound: it tells me that in the realm of projective geometry, there is essentially only one type of conic. This insight is a cornerstone of projective geometry and serves to illustrate the unifying power of the projective viewpoint.

5.4 Inversion and Its Role in Conic Transformations
Inversion is particularly useful when studying conic sections that are not easily classified by affine or projective methods alone. For example, consider the parabola. As noted earlier, by choosing an appropriate circle of inversion, a parabola can be mapped to a circle. This fact is not only a curiosity but also a useful tool in solving geometric problems. I recall a problem discussed on MathOverflow where an inversion was used to transform a complicated configuration involving a parabola into one involving a circle, thus making the problem more tractable. I suddenly thought that perhaps inversion should be regarded as a bridge between the linear world of conic sections and the non-linear realm of circle geometry.

5.5 Other Transformations and Their Impact on Conics
Let me now briefly discuss the impact of the other transformations on conic sections:

(a) Euclidean Transformations: Since these preserve distances and angles, they leave the metric properties of conics unchanged. Thus, the eccentricity of an ellipse, for example, remains invariant under rotations, translations, and reflections.

(b) Similarity Transformations: These preserve shapes up to scaling. In the case of conics, a similarity transformation will preserve the general form (ellipse, parabola, hyperbola) while possibly altering the size.

(c) Möbius Transformations: Although more commonly associated with complex analysis, Möbius transformations (when interpreted as projective transformations on the Riemann sphere) can also be applied to conic sections. They preserve circles and generalized circles (which include lines), and hence have interesting consequences for the study of conics.

I guess that the study of these transformation groups collectively provides a powerful toolkit for understanding the geometric properties of conic sections from multiple viewpoints.

6 The Erlangen Program

The Erlangen Program, formulated by Felix Klein in the 19th century, provides a unifying framework for understanding various geometries in terms of transformation groups. According to this philosophy, a geometry is characterized by the group of transformations under which its fundamental properties are invariant.

6.1 Fundamental Idea of the Erlangen Program

At the heart of the Erlangen Program is the following idea: Geometry is the study of properties that are invariant under a given group of transformations. For instance, in Euclidean geometry, the group of interest is the Euclidean group E(n) (consisting of rotations, translations, and reflections), and the invariants include distances and angles.

I find this perspective to be remarkably powerful. It allows me to recast many seemingly disparate geometric problems in terms of group theory. For example, the classification of conic sections can be viewed as an analysis of the invariants under various transformation groups. I suddenly thought that the Erlangen Program not only clarifies the underlying structures in geometry but also opens the door to many generalizations.

---

## 第 11 页

6.2 Transformation Groups and Geometric Structures
Let me enumerate several key examples of how different geometries are characterized by their corresponding transformation groups:

*   Euclidean Geometry: Defined by the Euclidean group E(n). Invariants include distances, angles, and the notion of congruence.
*   Affine Geometry: Defined by the affine group Aff(n). Invariants include collinearity and the ratio of lengths along a line, but not distances or angles.
*   Projective Geometry: Defined by the projective linear group PGL(n+1, R). Invariants include the cross-ratio and incidence relations.
*   Conformal Geometry: In two dimensions, this is often associated with Möbius transformations, where angles are preserved but not distances.

In my own study, I have often attempted to "connect the dots" between these different geometries by considering how one can transition from one group to another. For instance, I have noticed that the Euclidean group is a subgroup of the affine group, which in turn is a subgroup of the projective group. This hierarchical structure is perfectly in line with the philosophy of the Erlangen Program.

6.3 Application to Conic Sections
One of the most intriguing applications of the Erlangen Program is in the classification and study of conic sections. As I have already mentioned, conic sections can be viewed as objects that are invariant under various transformation groups. For example:

*   Under the full projective group, all nondegenerate conics are equivalent.
*   Under the affine group, conics fall into distinct classes (ellipse, parabola, hyperbola) based on invariants such as the discriminant of the quadratic form.
*   Under the Euclidean group, further metric properties (such as eccentricity) are preserved.

I suddenly thought that this stratification of conic sections based on the transformation group under consideration is a beautiful illustration of the Erlangen Program in action. In other words, the "shape" of a conic depends on what geometric properties one considers as fundamental.

6.4 Interpretation of Specific Transformations within the Erlangen Program
Let me now discuss in detail how the specific transformations we have studied fit into the Erlangen Program.

---

## 第 12 页

6.4.1 Affine Transformations in the Erlangen Framework
Affine geometry considers the affine group Aff(n), which is the semidirect product of GL(n, R) and R". The invariants of affine geometry are those properties of figures that remain unchanged under all affine transformations. For example, the parallelism of lines is an affine invariant, whereas angles and distances are not. I often find it instructive to compare this with Euclidean geometry: while Euclidean geometry is rigid (i.e., it preserves all distances), affine geometry is "softer" and permits distortions that still maintain the collinearity of points. I guess that this relaxation of constraints is precisely what makes affine geometry so versatile.

6.4.2 Projective Transformations in the Erlangen Framework
In projective geometry, the group PGL(n+1, R) governs the structure. The fact that any two nondegenerate conics are projectively equivalent is one of the key observations in the Erlangen Program. I sometimes muse over the fact that by extending the plane to include points at infinity, one can "simplify" the classification of curves. This radical shift in perspective is a hallmark of the Erlangen approach, where the focus is solely on invariants under a given group of transformations.

6.4.3 Inversion and Möbius Transformations in the Erlangen Context
Although inversion is not a group on its own (since it is not defined at the center of inversion), when combined with rotations and translations, it forms part of the Möbius group. In two-dimensional conformal geometry, the Möbius group is the transformation group of interest. Here, the invariants are angles and the cross-ratio. I suddenly thought that the link between inversion and Möbius transformations is yet another example of the unifying power of transformation groups in geometry. I guess that exploring these connections further might reveal even deeper insights into the structure of the complex plane and its associated geometries.

7 Explorations, Trials, and Side Discussions
In this section, I document my exploratory thought process, trial-and-error attempts, and various side discussions that have emerged while studying the interactions between transformation groups and conic sections. I stress that while some of the following ideas are well-established, others are speculative; thus, whenever I am uncertain, I will use phrases like "I guess" or "I suddenly thought maybe" to indicate that further investigation is required.

7.1 Initial Attempts at Unification
When I first embarked on the task of unifying the study of conic sections under various transformation groups, I began by considering a simple example: the ellipse. I asked myself: Can the properties of an ellipse be derived solely from its invariance under

a specific group of transformations? My initial approach was to attempt a direct computation of invariants under affine transformations.

I started with the general quadratic form
Q(x,y) = Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

By applying an affine transformation
(x/y) -> (u/v) = A₀(x/y) + b,

I derived the transformed quadratic form and tried to isolate the invariants. While the algebra quickly became messy, I gradually recognized that the discriminant Δ = B² - 4AC is preserved up to a multiplicative factor. I suddenly thought that this is a manifestation of the fact that the classification of conics (ellipse, parabola, hyperbola) is an affine invariant notion. I guess that a more systematic approach would involve the use of canonical forms and matrix diagonalization techniques. Indeed, when one represents the quadratic form by a symmetric matrix and performs a change of basis, one can reduce the form to one of a few standard types.

7.2 The Role of Homogeneous Coordinates in Simplification

One of the insights that emerged during my explorations was the usefulness of homogeneous coordinates in streamlining the analysis. By representing points as [x : y : z], I discovered that many of the awkward distinctions between conics disappear. For instance, the transformation of a conic under a projective transformation becomes a matter of conjugation by an invertible matrix. This realization was both liberating and a bit overwhelming. I suddenly thought that perhaps the complexity of Euclidean and affine computations is largely due to the insistence on inhomogeneous coordinates, and that a projective viewpoint offers a more natural setting. I guess that this insight is one of the key contributions of the Erlangen Program: it forces one to consider the full symmetry group of the geometric objects rather than a restricted subset.

7.3 Trial and Error with Inversion Techniques

I must confess that my initial attempts at using inversion to study conic sections were fraught with difficulties. At one point, I tried to use inversion to transform a hyperbola into a circle, with the hope that I could then apply well-known circle theorems to deduce properties of the hyperbola. However, the details of the transformation proved to be tricky. Inversion, as I learned, does not always preserve the "global" structure of a curve in a straightforward way. I suddenly thought maybe I should have first classified the curve into parts and then applied the inversion locally. I guess that further research is needed to fully understand the subtleties of this method. Nonetheless, the partial success of these attempts reaffirmed my belief that inversion is a powerful tool—even if it requires careful handling.

7.4 Comparisons with Known Literature and Online Discussions

Throughout my investigations, I have frequently consulted various sources such as textbooks, papers, and online resources like Wikipedia, nLab, MathStackExchange, and MathOverflow. One particularly memorable discussion on MathStackExchange addressed the invariance properties of the cross-ratio under projective transformations. In that discussion, participants carefully explained that the cross-ratio is the unique invariant of four collinear points under projective maps. I suddenly thought that this result might have analogues in higher dimensions. I guess that extending the notion of the cross-ratio to higher-dimensional projective spaces is a rich area of ongoing research.

Another fascinating discussion on MathOverflow dealt with the classification of conic sections under different transformation groups. The participants argued that while projectively all conics are equivalent, affine transformations distinguish them into distinct classes. This debate resonated with my own explorations, and I realized that my initial intuition was on the right track. I suddenly thought that these online communities are an invaluable resource, providing both rigor and inspiration in equal measure.

7.5 Speculative Connections to Advanced Topics

I now turn to some more speculative ideas that emerged during my explorations. At one point, I conjectured that there might be a deep connection between the invariants of conic sections and certain cohomological invariants in algebraic geometry. I guess that the modern language of schemes and sheaves could provide a unifying framework that extends the classical notions of invariance under transformation groups. Although this line of thought is still in its infancy, I suddenly thought maybe one day it could lead to a new perspective on the classification of algebraic curves.

Another speculative idea that I entertained was the possibility of defining a "universal transformation group" that would encompass all the transformation groups discussed so far Euclidean, similarity, affine, projective, and Möbius. While this notion is admittedly vague at present, I guess that if one could define such a group, its invariants would capture the essential geometric properties that persist across all levels of structure. I suddenly thought that this might even have implications in physics, where symmetry groups often play a crucial role in defining fundamental laws.

7.6 A Detailed Walkthrough of an Example: Transforming a Conic via Multiple Steps

To illustrate the interplay of different transformations, I now present a detailed walkthrough of an example. Consider the ellipse
$\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$.

---

## 第 15 页

I will describe a sequence of transformations that eventually maps this ellipse to a circle, then to a parabola, and finally to a hyperbola. I stress that this is not a unique procedure but rather a demonstration of the flexibility inherent in the transformation groups.

Step 1: Affine Normalization
First, I apply the affine transformation

u = x/2, v = y/3,

which transforms the ellipse into the unit circle:

u² + v² = 1.

Here, I appreciate that the affine transformation preserves the collinearity of points and maps the ellipse into a "nice" circle, although distances are not preserved in the metric sense.

Step 2: Projective Transformation to a Parabola
Next, I consider a projective transformation that maps the circle to a parabola. One standard choice is to use the transformation in homogeneous coordinates:

[u : v : w] -> [u : v - w : w].

In the affine patch where w = 1, the circle u² + v² = 1 is transformed into a curve that, after some algebra, turns out to be a parabola. I must admit that the explicit algebra can become quite involved: I guess that the details are best worked out on paper, but the key idea is that projective transformations can alter the type of a conic (section) drastically.

Step 3: Inversion to a Hyperbola
Finally, I apply an inversion with respect to a suitably chosen circle to transform the parabola into a hyperbola. Let the circle of inversion be centered at the origin with radius R. Under inversion, a parabola not passing through the origin is typically mapped to a hyperbola. I suddenly thought that this step illustrates the non-linear nature of inversion and its ability to "flip" the qualitative type of a conic. I guess that the choice of the circle of inversion is crucial here, and different choices may yield different results. This example demonstrates the rich interplay between various transformation groups.

7.7 Reflections on the Process and Open Questions
Throughout these explorations, I have often paused to ask myself several open questions:

---

## 第 16 页

Is there a canonical way to transition between different transformation groups when studying a given geometric problem? I guess that while there are standard procedures, a fully unified theory remains elusive.

Can one define invariants that capture the essence of a conic section across all these transformations? I suddenly thought maybe an algebraic invariant, perhaps one derived from the characteristic polynomial of an associated matrix, could serve this purpose.

What are the limitations of these transformations? I have encountered difficulties when trying to generalize certain properties from the Euclidean case to the projective or conformal settings. I guess that further research is needed in these areas.

These questions are not merely rhetorical; they represent avenues for further investigation. I find that the process of trial, error, and reflection is as valuable as any definitive answer.

8 Linking Transformations to the Erlangen Program in Detail

In this section, I take a closer look at how the various transformations discussed so far can be understood through the lens of the Erlangen Program. I will explore in depth the philosophy that geometry is the study of invariants under a transformation group, and I will illustrate how this viewpoint sheds light on the properties of conic sections.

8.1 Affine Geometry and Its Invariants

Recall that in affine geometry, the primary invariants are collinearity and the ratios of lengths along lines. The affine group Aff(n) is comprised of all transformations of the form

T(x) = Ax + b,

with A ∈ GL(n, R) and b ∈ R". One crucial invariant in this setting is the affine ratio of three collinear points P, Q, and R. Suppose Q divides the segment PR in the ratio λ : (1 - λ). Then, under any affine transformation, the same ratio holds. I suddenly thought that this invariance is the cornerstone of many affine properties and that it plays a crucial role in understanding how conic sections behave under affine maps.

For example, consider the center of an ellipse. Under an affine transformation, although the shape of the ellipse may change, the concept of its center (defined in terms of the intersection of its axes) remains intact. I guess that this preservation of centrality is deeply linked to the invariance of affine combinations.

8.2 Projective Geometry and the Cross-Ratio
In projective geometry, the invariant of central importance is the cross-ratio. Given four collinear points A, B, C, and D, their cross-ratio is defined as

(A, B, C, D) = (AC * BD) / (AD * BC)

with appropriate conventions for directed distances. The remarkable fact is that the cross-ratio is preserved under projective transformations. I suddenly thought that this property provides a robust way of characterizing conic sections in the projective plane.

Furthermore, when one considers the tangency relations of a conic, the cross-ratio often appears in the formulation of classical results, such as Pascal's and Brianchon's theorems. I guess that a deeper understanding of the cross-ratio could lead to new insights into the projective classification of conics. In my explorations, I have sometimes attempted to rederive classical theorems using only the invariance of the cross-ratio, and the results have been both illuminating and, at times, surprising.

8.3 Conformal Geometry and Möbius Transformations
In the realm of conformal geometry, the transformations of interest are those that preserve angles. Möbius transformations serve as the archetypal examples in two dimensions. As we have seen, a Möbius transformation is given by

f(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)

with ad - bc ≠ 0. The invariance of angles under Möbius transformations is one of the reasons they are so powerful in complex analysis. I suddenly thought that the conformal invariance provided by these transformations offers a different perspective on the geometry of conic sections. For instance, while distances and areas are not preserved under Möbius maps, the qualitative behavior of the curves, particularly their tangential properties, remains invariant.

I guess that this angle-preservation property is what allows one to translate problems in conic sections into the language of complex analysis. This connection is not only beautiful but also practically useful, as many problems become easier to handle when recast in a conformal setting.

8.4 A Unified Perspective on Conic Sections
Let me now attempt to synthesize the discussion so far. Conic sections can be studied from multiple geometric viewpoints:

*   Affine Perspective: Conics are distinguished by invariants such as the discriminant of the quadratic form.

*   Projective Perspective: All nondegenerate conics are equivalent; the focus is on invariants like the cross-ratio.

Conformal Perspective: Angle preservation is the key, with Möbius transformations revealing the underlying structure of the curves.

I suddenly thought that these three perspectives are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary. In many cases, a problem stated in one framework can be translated into another, where it may become simpler or more elegant. I guess that this is the true power of the Erlangen Program it provides a unifying language that bridges the gaps between different geometric theories.

8.5 An Extended Example: From Ellipse to Circle via the Erlangen Lens

Let me return to the example of transforming an ellipse to a circle, but now interpret it in the language of the Erlangen Program. Consider the ellipse

x²/a² + y²/b² = 1.

In Euclidean geometry, the ellipse has distinct metric properties (e.g., eccentricity) that are preserved under Euclidean transformations. However, if I step into the affine realm, I can apply the transformation

u = x/a, v = y/b,

which maps the ellipse to the circle

u² + v² = 1.

From the viewpoint of the Erlangen Program, the Euclidean properties (distances, angles) are not fundamental in affine geometry; what matters are the invariants under the affine group, such as the collinearity of points and the affine ratio. I suddenly thought that this example perfectly encapsulates the essence of the Erlangen Program: the same geometric object (an ellipse) can be perceived differently depending on the transformation group under consideration.

8.6 Speculative Thoughts on a "Meta-Geometry"

I now indulge in a speculative thought: is it possible to construct a meta-geometry that simultaneously encompasses Euclidean, affine, projective, and conformal geometries? I guess that such an approach would require a careful analysis of the common invariants across these groups. For instance, while Euclidean geometry values distances and angles, affine geometry values ratios and collinearity, and projective geometry values cross-ratios. One might imagine a framework in which these invariants appear as different "facets" of a more abstract invariant. I suddenly thought that this line of inquiry might connect with recent developments in category theory or higher-dimensional algebra, where one seeks to understand structures through the interplay of various transformation groups. Although I am far from having a definitive answer, I guess that exploring such ideas could lead to a richer understanding of geometry as a whole.

8.7 Interplay with Modern Research and Open Questions
Modern research, as evidenced by discussions on platforms like MathOverflow and nLab, often grapples with questions about the relationships between different geometries. For example, one open question is whether there exists a natural transformation that "interpolates" between affine and projective invariants in a way that retains the best of both worlds. I suddenly thought that this might be related to the concept of duality in projective geometry, where every statement has a dual statement. I guess that investigating such dualities further could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the structure of conic sections and their invariants.

9 Further Discussions and Detailed Derivations
In this section, I present several detailed derivations, computations, and discussions that illustrate the interplay of transformations with conic sections. I endeavor to include every step of my thought process, even when the calculations become messy. My hope is that by laying bare my reasoning. I not only clarify the results but also provide a window into the creative process of mathematical exploration.

9.1 Diagonalization of Quadratic Forms Under Affine Transformations
Consider a general quadratic form in two variables:
Q(x,y) = Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey - F.

My goal is to diagonalize this quadratic form via an affine transformation. I begin by completing the square to eliminate the linear terms. Setting
x = X + h, y = Y + k.

I choose h and k so that the linear part vanishes. The conditions for h and k are given by
2Ah + Bk + D = 0, Bh + 2Ck + E = 0.

I suddenly thought that these equations are simply the conditions for the translation part of the affine transformation to move the origin to the center of the conic. I guess that solving these equations simultaneously yields the coordinates of the center.

Once the center is determined, the quadratic form becomes
Q(X,Y) = AX² + BXY + CY² + constant.

Next, I perform a rotation of the coordinate system to eliminate the XY term. This is achieved by setting
X = u cos θ - v sin θ, Y = u sin θ + v cos θ,

and choosing θ such that the coefficient of uv is zero. A standard computation shows that

tan 2θ = B/(A-C)

I suddenly thought that this angle θ is precisely the one that aligns the coordinate axes with the principal axes of the conic. I guess that after this rotation, the quadratic form takes the diagonal form

Q(u, v) = λ₁u² + λ₂v² + constant,

where λ₁ and λ₂ are the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix

This procedure, though algebraically intensive, is a standard application of linear algebra to geometry. I suddenly thought that this derivation not only solidifies the connection between affine transformations and quadratic forms but also provides a natural pathway to classifying conics.

9.2 Derivation of the Cross-Ratio Invariance

I now turn to a derivation of the invariance of the cross-ratio under projective transformations. Suppose we have four distinct collinear points A, B, C, and D with coordinates a, b, c, and d (in some affine chart). The cross-ratio is defined by

{A, B; C, D} = (c-a)(d-b) / (d-a)(c-b)

Consider a projective transformation of the form

x ↦ x' = (αx + β) / (γx + δ)

with αδ – βγ ≠ 0. I attempted a direct computation to show that the cross-ratio is preserved. After a rather involved calculation, I arrived at the conclusion that

{A, B; C, D} = {A', B'; C', D'},

where A', B', C', and D' are the images of A, B, C, and D, respectively. I suddenly thought that this derivation is an excellent example of how a complicated expression simplifies dramatically under the right transformation, a recurring theme in the Erlangen Program. I guess that the invariance of the cross-ratio is not accidental but rather a deep reflection of the underlying symmetry of the projective line.

9.3 Inversion Formula Revisited

Returning to the inversion transformation, I now provide a more detailed derivation of the inversion formula in Cartesian coordinates. Let (x, y) be the coordinates of a

point P in the plane, and let (x', y') be the coordinates of its inversion P' with respect to a circle centered at the origin with radius R. By definition, we have:

√(x^2 + y^2) * √(x'^2 + y'^2) = R^2.

Assuming that P and P' lie on the same ray from the origin, we can write

(x', y') = λ(x, y)

for some scalar λ. Substituting into the above equation, we find

√(x^2 + y^2) * |λ|√(x^2 + y^2) = R^2,

or equivalently,

λ = R^2 / (x^2 + y^2).

Thus, the inversion is given by

(x, y) -> (R^2x / (x^2 + y^2), R^2y / (x^2 + y^2)).

I suddenly thought that this derivation is deceptively simple yet encapsulates the essence of inversion: distances from the origin are reciprocated (up to the factor R²). I guess that understanding this basic formula is key to applying inversion in more complicated geometric settings.

9.4 Combining Transformations: A Composite Map

In many practical situations, it is necessary to combine several transformations. For example, consider the composite transformation T = I ∘ A ∘ P, where I denotes inversion, A an affine transformation, and P a projective transformation. I attempted to compute the composite effect of these transformations on a conic section. Although the algebra becomes extremely involved, the guiding principle is that each transformation preserves a specific set of invariants. I suddenly thought that the art of combining transformations is much like composing functions in analysis: one must carefully keep track of the invariants at each stage.

I guess that a systematic study of composite transformations could lead to powerful new methods in solving classical geometric problems. For instance, by choosing the order of transformations appropriately, one might simplify the equation of a conic or reveal hidden symmetries that are not apparent in the original coordinates.

10 Additional Examples and Long-Winding Discussions

To further illustrate the concepts discussed above, I now provide several additional examples and engage in long-winded discussions that showcase the interplay between theory and computation. These examples are intended to demonstrate the richness of the subject and to encourage further exploration.

10.1 Example: Transforming a Hyperbola to a Standard Form
Consider the hyperbola given by
9x² - 16y² - 18x - 32y + 64 = 0.

My first step is to complete the square for both x and y. I group the terms in x and y as follows:
9x² - 18x - 16y² - 32y = -64.

Dividing through by the common factors and completing the square, I write
9(x² - 2x + 1) - 9 - 16(y² + 2y + 1) + 16 = -64.

This yields
9(x - 1)² - 16(y + 1)² = -64 + 9 - 16 = -71.

I suddenly thought that the negative sign on the right-hand side indicates that we are indeed dealing with a hyperbola (the standard form being (y+1)² / α² - (x-1)² / β² = 1 or vice versa). After some algebra, I obtain the standard form by dividing both sides appropriately. I guess that once the hyperbola is in standard form, one can easily analyze its asymptotes and foci.

10.2 Example: A Möbius Transformation Mapping Three Points
Consider three distinct points on the extended complex plane, say 0, 1, and ∞. I wish to find a Möbius transformation that maps these points to -1, i, and 1, respectively. I set up the transformation in the form
f(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d), ad - bc ≠ 0.

The conditions f(0) = -1, f(1) = i, and f(∞) = 1 translate into:
f(0) = b / d = -1,
f(1) = (a + b) / (c + d) = i,
f(∞) = a / c = 1.

From f(∞) = 1, I deduce that a = c. From f(0) = -1, it follows that b = -d. Substituting into f(1) = i, I obtain
(a - d) / (c + d) = (a - d) / (a + d) = i.

I suddenly thought that this equation can be solved for d in terms of a. After cross-multiplying, I arrive at
a - d = i(a + d).

This yields
a - d = ia + id ⇒ a(1 - i) = d(1 + i).

Thus, I have
d= (1-i)/(1+i^a)

I note that simplifies to a unimodular complex number (indeed, it can be shown to have absolute value 1). I guess that this example, while elementary, illustrates the computational techniques one must master when dealing with Möbius transformations. I suddenly thought that such explicit examples are invaluable in solidifying one's understanding of abstract concepts.

10.3 Long-Winding Discussion on the Nature of Invariants

One of the most challenging aspects of the subject is determining which properties of a geometric figure remain invariant under a given transformation group. For affine transformations, the invariants include collinearity and ratios along lines, while for projective transformations, the cross-ratio is fundamental. I often find myself pondering the following question: Is there a universal language of invariants that transcends the boundaries of these different geometries?

I suddenly thought that one possible approach to answering this question is to adopt a categorical perspective. In category theory, one often studies objects in terms of the maps between them, rather than the objects themselves. I guess that by interpreting geometric transformations as morphisms in an appropriate category, one might be able to identify a common invariant that is intrinsic to the category. For instance, the notion of a limit or a colimit might provide the conceptual framework to unify the various invariants encountered in Euclidean, affine, and projective geometries. While this approach is highly speculative, I suddenly thought maybe it could open new avenues for research.

Another perspective is to consider differential invariants. In the context of smooth manifolds, one often studies invariants under the action of Lie groups. For example, the curvature of a curve or a surface is a differential invariant under Euclidean motions. I guess that exploring the differential-geometric analogues of the invariants discussed earlier could yield interesting results. I suddenly thought that such an investigation might even connect with modern theories in physics, where symmetry and invariance play a central role.

10.4 Discussion on the Role of Transformation Groups in Modern Mathematics

It is impossible to overstate the importance of transformation groups in modern mathematics. From Lie groups and algebraic groups to the more exotic infinite-dimensional groups encountered in functional analysis, the concept of a group acting on a space is ubiquitous. I suddenly thought that the study of geometric transformations is not merely an isolated topic in classical geometry but is deeply interwoven with many areas of contemporary mathematics.

For example, in algebraic geometry, the study of automorphism groups of varieties often reveals subtle properties of the underlying spaces. Similarly, in differential

geometry, the action of a Lie group on a manifold can lead to powerful results such as the classification of homogeneous spaces. I guess that the Erlangen Program was, in many ways, a precursor to these modern developments. I suddenly thought that revisiting Klein's ideas with the benefit of modern mathematical language could yield insights that are both historically enlightening and mathematically profound.

10.5 An Extended Example: The Complete Transformation of a Conic

To further illustrate the power of combining various transformations, I now present an extended example that tracks the complete transformation of a conic section through a sequence of maps. Consider the conic defined by

Q(x,y) = 2x² + 3xy + y² - 4x + 5y - 6 = 0.

I wish to perform the following sequence:

(a) Apply an affine translation to center the conic.

(b) Rotate the coordinate system to diagonalize the quadratic part.

(c) Apply a scaling transformation to normalize the coefficients.

(d) Finally, apply a projective transformation that maps the conic to a canonical form.

Step (a): Translation I first solve for the center (h,k) by setting the partial derivatives of Q with respect to x and y to zero:

∂Q/∂x = 4x + 3y - 1 = 0, ∂Q/∂y = 3x + 2y + 5 = 0.

Solving these simultaneously, I obtain the center (h,k). (The detailed algebra is lengthy, but the key point is to find a translation that removes the linear terms.) I suddenly thought that this step is analogous to shifting the origin to the "heart" of the conic, which is a concept that appears repeatedly in both classical and modern treatments of conic sections.

Step (b): Rotation After translation, the quadratic form becomes

Q(X,Y) = A'X² + B'XY + C'Y² + constant,

where X = x - h and Y = y - k. I then choose an angle θ such that

tan 2θ = B' / (A' - C').

This rotation eliminates the cross term, resulting in

Q(u, v) = λ₁u² + λ₂v² + constant,

where u and v are the new coordinates. I guess that this standard procedure of diagonalizing a quadratic form is a key example of how linear algebra and geometry interact.

Step (c): Scaling The next step involves scaling the coordinates to normalize the quadratic coefficients. For instance, if λ₁ and λ₂ are both nonzero. I can define new variables

U = √λ₁ u, V = √λ₂ v,

so that the quadratic part becomes U² ± V² (with the sign depending on the original conic). I suddenly thought that this scaling is a similarity transformation, and it highlights how conic sections can be classified up to similarity. I guess that this is a natural transition to the final step.

Step (d): Projective Transformation Finally, I consider a projective transformation that sends the normalized conic to a canonical form. For a hyperbola or ellipse, the canonical form is typically

U² ± V² = 1,

while for a parabola, it is

V = U².

I suddenly thought that this final mapping encapsulates the idea that, projectively, all conics are equivalent (in the nondegenerate case). I guess that this transformation sequence, though technically challenging, provides a comprehensive view of the power of combining different transformation groups to achieve a unified classification of conic sections.
