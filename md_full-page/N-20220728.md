叫做空间向量的长度或模

2. 特别地, 我们将长度为0的向量叫做零向量, 记为0, 将长度为1的向量叫做单位向量.
与向量长度相等而方向相反的向量叫做的反向量, 记为-a.

3. 如果表示若干空间向量的有向线段所在的直线互相平行或重合, 那么这些向量叫做共线

5. a x (b+c)=a x b + a x c.
6. (a+b)x c = a x c + b x c.
7. (λa) x b = λ(a x b) = a x (λb).

i x j = k
|a x b| = |a||b|sin<a,b>

今天来看 Vakil的 The Rising Sea.
Our general approach will be as follows. I will try to tell you what you need to
know, and no more. (This I promise: if I use the word "topoi", you can shoot me.) I
will begin by telling you things you already know, and describing what is essential
about the examples, in a way that we can abstract a more general definition. We
will then see this definition in less familiar settings, and get comfortable with using
it to solve problems and prove theorems.
For example, we will define the notion of product of schemes. We could just
give a definition of product, but then you should want to know why this precise
definition deserves the name of "product". As a motivation, we revisit the notion
of product in a situation we know well: (the category of) sets. One way to define
the product of sets U and V is as the set of ordered pairs {(u, v): u∈ U, v ∈ V).
But someone from a different mathematical culture might reasonably define it as
the set of symbols: u∈ U, v ∈ V}. These notions are "obviously the same".
Better: there is "an obvious bijection between the two".

This can be made precise by giving a better definition of product, in terms of a universal property. Given two sets M and N, a product is a set P, along with maps μ: P → M and v: P → N, such that for any set P' with maps μ': P' → M and v': P' → N, these maps must factor uniquely through P:

(1.1.0.1)

(The symbol ∃ means "there exists", and the symbol ! here means "unique".) Thus a product is a diagram

and not just a set P, although the maps μ and v are often left implicit.

某种意义上这种定义挺符合直觉的。我感觉独立性其实也就暗示了有序性,不过这样定义确实回避了 product 只是某个特定集合的情况。现在还想不到什么很脱离直党的例子。

This definition agrees with the traditional definition, with one twist: there isn't just a single product; but any two products come with a unique isomorphism between them. In other words, the product is unique up to unique isomorphism. Here is why: if you have a product

and I have a product

因此由 universal property 可知:存在唯一的f,g,使得以下图交换

同样,让P同时充当P,P的角色,则存在唯一的映射,我们称之为idp,使得以下图交换:
就是identity map

很容易看出=P2P,因此有fog=idp,同样gof=idp,
∴由universal property 得出的f.g为双射,我们可以唯一地命名MXN

This definition has the advantage that it works in many circumstances, and
once we define categories, we will soon see that the above argument applies ver-
batim in any category to show that products, if they exist, are unique up to unique
isomorphism. Even if you haven't seen the definition of category before, you can
verify that this agrees with your notion of product in some category that you have
seen before (such as the category of vector spaces, where the maps are taken to
be linear maps; or the category of differentiable manifolds, where the maps are
taken to be submersions, i.e., differentiable maps whose differential is everywhere
surjective). Я узушна иженжон я нет изюаруод лицзирэ!

A category consists of a collection of objects, and for each pair of objects, a
set of morphisms (or arrows) between them. (For experts: technically, this is the
definition of a locally small category. In the correct definition, the morphisms need
only form a class, not necessarily a set, but see Caution 0.3.1.) Morphisms are often
informally called maps. The collection of objects of a category 6 is often denoted
obj(6), but we will usually denote the collection also by 6. If A, B ∈ 6, then the
set of morphisms from A to B is denoted Mor(A, B). A morphism is often written
f: A→ B, and A is said to be the source of f, and B the target of f. (Of course,
Mor(A, B) is taken to be disjoint from Mor(A', B') unless A = A' and B = B'.)

Morphisms compose as expected: there is a composition Mor(B, C)×Mor(A, B) →
Mor(A, C), and if f ∈ Mor(A, B) and g∈ Mor(B, C), then their composition is de-
noted gof. Composition is associative: if f ∈ Mor(A, B), g∈ Mor(B, C), and
he Mor(C, D), then ho (gof) = (hog) of. For each object A∈ 6, there is always
an identity morphism ida: A→ A, such that when you (left- or right-)compose a
morphism with the identity, you get the same morphism. More precisely, for any
morphisms f: A B and g: BC, id off and gidß g. (If you wish,

you may check that "identity morphisms are unique": there is only one morphism
deserving the name ida.) This ends the definition of a category.
We have a notion of isomorphism between two objects of a category (a mor-
phism f: A → B such that there exists some necessarily unique morphism
g: B→ A, where fog and go f are the identity on B and A respectively), and a
notion of automorphism of an object (an isomorphism of the object with itself).

1.2.2. Example. The prototypical example to keep in mind is the category of sets,
denoted Sets. The objects are sets, and the morphisms are maps of sets. (Because
Russell's paradox shows that there is no set of all sets, we did not say earlier that
there is a set of all objects. But as stated in §0.3, we are deliberately omitting all
set-theoretic issues.)

1.2.3. Example. Another good example is the category Veck of vector spaces over
a given field k. The objects are k-vector spaces, and the morphisms are linear
transformations. (What are the isomorphisms?)

1.2.A. UNIMPORTANT EXERCISE. A category in which each morphism is an iso-
morphism is called a groupoid. (This notion is not important in what we will
discuss. The point of this exercise is to give you some practice with categories, by
relating them to an object you know well.)
(a) A perverse definition of a group is: a groupoid with one object. Make sense of
this.
(b) Describe a groupoid that is not a group.
Халузяху, 其中热了。я ханьдао йле юнцюйд ехамиле в Math Overflow:
3阶魔方的操作构成一个群,15块拼图的操作构成一个groupaid.(如右图)
如右图,展示了空格地可能拉的16个位置及其移动方法
两个操作被视为相同当且仅当它们的起点和终点相同,
且对数字的影响相同。
和魔方不同的是,15拼团的操作并不总是能复合的。
操作需要满足:小其复合仍是一个操作(封闭性)(2)操作是可逆的(可连性)
这样的操作有167,382,319,104,000种。

一类情况是只有一个obj的groupoid是group,并非每两个obj之间都
存在映射的groupoid是一族群。
另一类情况,所有等低关系都是一个groupoid,对于a,bEobjCURJ
