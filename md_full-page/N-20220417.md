2 Fundamentals of Inequalities April 16, 2022

The quantity P(r) is called the rth power mean. Note that if we set all the weights equal, that is w₁ = w₂ = ... = w = 1, then
To save the space, we will introduce three tricks from the pre-pages.
1. product!
P(r) = (a₁ + a₂ + ... + aₙ / n)¹/r r≠0
If it says abc=1. we can let a = x/y, b = y/z, c = z/x, w.l.o.g. r=0.
Corollary 2.7 (QM-AM-GM-HM theorem). Let a₁, ..., aₙ be positive real numbers. Then
2. Ravi substitution
√(a₁² + ... + aₙ²) / n ≥ (a₁ + ... + aₙ) / n ≥ ⁿ√(a₁a₂...aₙ) ≥ n / (1/a₁ + ... + 1/aₙ)
If a.b.c are three sides of a triangle, we can replace ca, b, a
Proof. Set r ∈ {2,1,0,-1} we obtain the inequality
with (x+y, y+z, z+x)
Here "QM" and "HM" stand for "quadratic mean" and "harmonic mean"
Here is an application of a ⅓-power mean. ∑ cyc a²(ca²+bc) ≥ ∑ cyc a^(r+1) c(b+c)
3. Schur inequality
Example 14 (Taiwan TST 2014). Let a, b, c > 0. Prove that
When r=1, that's the common form we use:
3(a+b+c) ≥ 8∛abc + √(a³ + b³ + c³) / 3
a³+b³+c³ + 3abc ≥ ∑ cyc a²b

Solution 14. By Power Mean with r = 1, s = ⅓, and weights 1/9 + 8/9 = 1 we have the inequality
(1/9 √(a³ + b³ + c³) / 3 + 8/9 ∛abc)³ ≤ 1/9 (a³ + b³ + c³) / 3 + 8/9 (abc).
Thus it is enough to prove a³+b³+c³+24abc ≤ (a+b+c)³, which is clear.
→ Example: (a²+b²)(c²+d²) ≥ (ac+bd)²

§2.4.2 Cauchy and Hölder vector form: |a|⋅|b| ≥ |a⋅b|
We now present Hölder's inequality; we state the two-variable form for concreteness but the obvious generalization to any number of sequences is valid.

Theorem 2.8 (Hölder's inequality). Let p and q be positive real numbers. Let a₁, ..., aₙ, b₁, ..., bₙ be nonnegative real numbers. Then
(∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢᵖ)¹/ᵖ (∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ bᵢq)¹/q ≥ (∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ ᵖ⁺q√aᵢᵖbᵢq)¹/(p+q)
When p=q=1, that is Cathy's inequality:
∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢ ⋅ ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ bᵢ ≥ (∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ √aᵢbᵢ)²

Solution 16. This time, we use Hölder with slightly changed weights in order to remove the square root:

(∑𝑎/√𝑏+𝑐)2(∑𝑎(𝑏+𝑐))≥(𝑎+𝑏+𝑐)3.
𝑐𝑦𝑐 𝑐𝑦𝑐

Again it is enough to prove (𝑎+𝑏+𝑐)2≥3∑𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑎(𝑏+𝑐) which is true by expanding.

Exercise. Show that if one sets 𝑏𝑖=1 for each 𝑖, then Hölder's inequality reduces to a power mean inequality with all weights equal.

§2.5 Inequalities in arbitrary functions

Let 𝐼 be an open interval (for example 𝐼=(0,∞) or 𝐼=(0,1)) and let 𝑓:(𝑢,𝑣)→ℝ be a function and let 𝑎1,𝑎2,...,𝑎𝑛∈(𝑢,𝑣). Suppose that we fix 𝑎1+𝑎2+...+𝑎𝑛=𝑎 (if the inequality is homogeneous, we will often insert such a condition) and we want to prove that

𝑓(𝑎1)+𝑓(𝑎2)+...+𝑓(𝑎𝑛)

is at least (or at most) 𝑛𝑓(𝑎). In this section we will provide two methods for doing so.

Definition 2.10. We say that function 𝑓 is convex if the second derivative 𝑓′′ is nonnegative over all of (𝑢,𝑣). Similarly we say it is concave if 𝑓′′(𝑥)≤0 for all 𝑥. Note that 𝑓 is convex if and only if −𝑓 is concave.

Let 𝑝>0, 𝑞>0, 1/𝑝+1/𝑞=1, 𝑓(𝑥)=ln(𝑥), then 1/𝑝ln𝑥+1/𝑞lny≤ln(𝑝𝑥+𝑞𝑦)
§2.5.1 Jensen and Karamata i.e. 𝑥1/𝑝𝑦1/𝑞≤𝑝𝑥+𝑞𝑦

We have the following analog of AM-GM now.

Theorem 2.11 (Jensen's inequality). Let 𝑓:𝐼→ℝ be a convex function. Then for any 𝑎1,...,𝑎𝑛∈𝐼 we have

加权: 𝑓(𝑎1)+...+𝑓(𝑎𝑛)/𝑛≥𝑓(𝑎1+...+𝑎𝑛/𝑛).
𝑝1𝑓(𝑥1)+...+𝑝𝑛𝑓(𝑥𝑛)≤𝑓(𝑝1𝑥1+...+𝑝𝑛𝑥𝑛).

The reverse inequality holds when 𝑓 is concave.

Exercise. Show that if one takes 𝐼=(0,∞) and 𝑓 to be the natural logarithm, then Jensen reduces to AM-GM with all weights equal.

Just as Muirhead is repeated AM-GM, there is an analog of repeated Jensen; however its use is somewhat rarer.

Theorem 2.12 (Karamata's inequality). Let 𝑓:𝐼→ℝ be convex. Suppose the sequence (𝑥𝑛) majorizes (𝑦𝑛), with each 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑦𝑖 in 𝐼. Then

参见前文"λ" 𝑓(𝑥1)+...+𝑓(𝑥𝑛)≥𝑓(𝑦1)+...+𝑓(𝑦𝑛).

The reverse inequality holds when 𝑓 is concave.
