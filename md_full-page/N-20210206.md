INFORMAL NOTES ON

Relations, Products and Intergers
This chapter includes Section 0.4 to 0.6 of the original book.
Definition 2.0.1. The Cartesion product of sets (or classes) A and B is the set (class)
A x B = {(a, b) | a∈ A,b∈ B}
A subset (subclass) of R is a relation on A x B.
Definition 2.0.2. A relation R on A x A is an equivalence relation on A provided R is
(i) reflexive: (a,a) ∈ R for all a ∈ A.
(ii) symmetric: (a, b) ∈ R implies (b,a) ∈ R.
(iii) transitive: (a,b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R implies (a, c) ∈ R.
If (a, b) ∈ R for equivalence relation R then we denote this as a~b. For a ∈ A, the
equivalence class if a is the class a of all elements of A which are equivalent to a. The
class of all equivalence classes in A is denoted A/R (called the quotient class of A by
R).
Proposition 2.0.3 Since R is reflexive, a ∈ a for every a ∈ A; then

a ≠ 0 for every a ⊂ A
U a = A = U a
a∈A a∈A/R
And also,
a = b <=> a ~ b (2.3)
Lemma 2.0.4
For a, b ∈ R and R an equivalence relation on A × A, we have either a ∩ b = 0, or
a = b.
Definition 2.0.5. Let A be a nonempty class and {Ai | i ∈ I} a family of subsets of A
such that:
(i) Ai ≠ 0 for all i ∈ I
(ii) Ui∈I Ai = A
(iii) Ai ∩ Aj = 0 for all i ≠ j where i, j ∈ I
Then {Ai | i ∈ I} is a partition of A.

Note 2 - This is one of the most useful properties of an equivalence relation. We will meet it again when we study Section 1.4.

Definition 2.0.6. Let {A; | i ∈ I} be a family of sets indexed by a nonempty set I (1.0.1). The Cartesian product of the sets A; is the set of all functions f: I → ∪ᵢ∈I Aᵢ such that f(i) ∈ Aᵢ for all i ∈ I. The set of functions is denoted ∏ᵢ∈I Aᵢ.

If I = {1, 2, ..., n}, the product ∏ᵢ∈I Aᵢ is often denoted by A₁ × A₂ × ... × Aₙ and is identified with the set of all ordered n-tuples (a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ), where aᵢ ∈ Aᵢ for i = 1, 2, ..., n just as in the case mentioned above, where I = {1, 2}.

Note 3 - If I = {1, 2} and we have sets A₁ and A₂, then the Cartesian product A₁ × A₂ consists of all pairs {(a₁, a₂) | a₁ ∈ A₁, a₂ ∈ A₂}. We can associate this with a function f: I → A₁ ∪ A₂ where f(1) ∈ A₁ and f(2) ∈ A₂. So function f is "associated" with pair (f(1), f(2)) (and conversely).

Definition 2.0.7. Let ∏ᵢ∈I Aᵢ be a Cartesian product. For each k ∈ I define a map πₖ: ∏ᵢ∈I Aᵢ → Aₖ, f ↦ f(k) (or in another notation, {aᵢ} ↦ aₖ), then πₖ is called the (canonical) projection of the product onto its kᵗʰ component.

Example 2.0.8
Let I = ℝ and Aᵢ = ℂ for all i ∈ I. Then an element of ∏ᵢ∈I Aᵢ = ∏ᵢ∈I ℂ is a function f that maps ℝ → ℂ. Say f(x) = ix. Applying πₖ to f (where k ∈ I = ℝ) gives πₖ(f) = f(k) = ik.

Theorem 2.0.9
Let {Aᵢ | i ∈ I} be a family of sets indexed by I. Then there exists a set D, together with a family of maps πᵢ: D → Aᵢ | i ∈ I with the following property: For any set C and family of maps φᵢ: C → Aᵢ, i ∈ I, there exists a unique map φ: C → D such that πᵢφ = φᵢ for all i ∈ I. Furthermore, D is uniquely determined up to a bijection.

Note 4 - Appears! Universal property! It will have much use when we start learning category (in Section 1.7, but we'll meet it in Jacky's salon later). The proof is a bit long and difficult to understand in a short time, so we may put off it until we have the systematic learning.

Now we comes to the integers. The system we use is that of five axioms by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano in 1899.

Axiom 1. 0 is a number.

Axiom 2. The immediate successor of a number is a number.

Axiom 3. 0 is not the immediate successor of a number.

Axiom 4. No two numbers have the same immediate successor.

Axiom 5. Any property belonging to 0, and also to the immediate successor of every number that has the property, belongs to all numbers.

Axiom 5 is called the Principle of Mathematical Induction.

Theorem 2.0.10 (Principle of Mathematical Induction)
If S is a subset of the set NU {0} such that 0∈ S and either
(i) n∈ S implies n + 1 ∈ S for all n∈ NU {0}, or
(ii) m∈ S for all 0 ≤ m < n implies n∈ S for all n∈ NJ {0}, then S = NJ {0}.

Proof. If N-S≠ 0, let n≠0 be its least element. Then for every m<n, we must have
m∉N-S and hence m ∈ S. Consequently either (i) or (ii) implies n ∈ S, which is a
contradiction. Therefore N-S = ∅ and N = S.

Theorem 2.0.11 (Division Algorithm)
If a, b ∈ Z and a ≠ 0, then there exist unique integers q and r such that b = aq+r, and
0 ≤ r < |a|.

Definition 2.0.12. Integer a ≠ 0 divides an integer b(written a|b) if there is an integer
k such that ak = b. If a does not divide b we write a ∤ b.

Definition 2.0.13. The positive integer c is the greatest common divisor of the integers
a₁, a₂,..., aₙ if
* c|aᵢ, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n
* d ∈ Z and d|aᵢ, for 1 < i < n implies d|c.

c is denoted (a₁, a₂,..., aₙ)

Definition 2.0.14. Let m > 0 be a fixed integer. If a, b ∈ Z and m|(a - b) then a is
congruent to b modulo m.

Theorem 2.0.15
Let m > 0 be an integer and a, b, c, d ∈ Z.
(i) Congruence modulo m is an equivalence relation on Z, which has precisely m
equivalence classes.
(ii) If a ≡ b(mod m) and c ≡ d(mod m), then a + c ≡ b+d(mod m) and ac ≡
bd(mod m).
(iii) If ab ≡ ac(mod m) and a and m are relatively prime, then b ≡ c(mod m).

Proof. Left as exercise.
