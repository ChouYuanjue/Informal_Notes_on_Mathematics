Category Theory (Continued & Topology)
昨天看Cat.看到一半就流成看~Alg.Top了,今天继续。

Example 57.2.2 (Interval modulo endpoints)
Suppose we take D' = [-1,1] and quotient by the equivalence relation which identifies
the endpoints -1 and 1. (Formally, x ~ y <=> (x = y) or {x,y} = {-1,1}.) In
that case, we simply recover S¹:

-1
D¹
-1
-1 ~ 1
S¹ ≈ D¹/~

Observe that a small open neighborhood around -1 ~ 1 in the quotient space
corresponds to two half-intervals at -1 and 1 in the original space D¹. This should
convince you the definition we gave is the right one.

Example 57.2.3 (More quotient spaces)
Convince yourself that:
• Generalizing the previous example, Dⁿ modulo its boundary Sⁿ⁻¹ is Sⁿ.
• Given a square ABCD, suppose we identify segments AB and DC together.
Then we get a cylinder. (Think elementary school, when you would tape up
pieces of paper together to get cylinders.)
• In the previous example, if we also identify BC and DA together, then we get
a torus. (Imagine taking our cylinder and putting the two circles at the end
together.)
• Let X = ℝ, and let x ~ y if y - x ∈ ℤ. Then X/~ is S¹ as well.

Definition 57.2.4. Let A ⊆ X. Consider the equivalence relation which identifies all
the points of A with each other while leaving all remaining points inequivalent. (In other
words, x ~ y if x = y or x, y ∈ A.) Then the resulting quotient space is denoted X/A.

So in this notation,
Dⁿ/Sⁿ⁻¹ = Sⁿ.

说实话,我感觉这里解释的商集多少有点问题,比如ℤ/7ℤ这种就不能这样看。

A quotient set is what you get when you "divide" a set A by B ⊆ A, wherein you set all elements of B to the identity in A. For example, if A = Z and B = {5n | n ∈ Z}, then you're making all multiples of 5 zero for all intents and purposes, so the quotient is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

这个MSE上的解释又只符合后一种情况了。
我个人认为X/Y is “X modulo 丫”比较合适,但modulo实在不好说,只是符合直觉。比如12/5Z,你可以认为是指
对于每个int modubs取等价类,但D/5+就不好说怎么modulo了,当然X/Y本来就乱,比如:
(i) 2/5Z.实指Z/R, XRys/(x-y)(实际上是陪集和商群那块的了)
(iⅱ) D/s+,实指D/R, XRy x=y or Xiy&sht
(iii) X/R, R = {(x,y)]xyex](西序」,实际上R就是指一个equ.relation,只不过这成集合形式。
(iv) X/Y, Y=X/R,这个比较离谱,它商出来的是一个关系,就是尺,当然也可以同们理解成集合。
当然,(iv)中X/R要理解成义的子集的集族,这时也是把尺视为义的一个划分

§57.3 Product topology

Prototypical example for this section: R× R is R², S¹ × S¹ is the torus.

Definition 57.3.1. Given topological spaces X and Y, the product topology on X×Y is the space whose

*   Points are pairs (x, y) with x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, and
*   Topology is given as follows: the basis of the topology for X×Y is U × V, for U ⊆ X open and V ⊆ Y open.

Remark 57.3.2 — It is not hard to show that, in fact, one need only consider basis elements for U and V. That is to say,

{U × V | U, V basis elements for X, Y}

is also a basis for X × Y.

We really do need to fiddle with the basis: in R× R, an open unit disk better be open, despite not being of the form U × V.

This does exactly what you think it would.

Example 57.3.5 (More product spaces)

(a) R× R is the Euclidean plane.

(b) S¹ × [0, 1] is a cylinder.

(c) S¹ × S¹ is a torus! (Why?)

Example 57.3.3 (The unit square)
Let X = [0, 1] and consider X × X. We of course expect this to be the unit square.
Pictured below is an open set of X × X in the basis.
V
U × V
U
关于S, XS, 二下这个, 其实有好几种看法, 改天不知道能不能用LaTeX整理一下。
