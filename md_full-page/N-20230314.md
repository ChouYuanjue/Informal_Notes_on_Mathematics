Category Theory (Continued)

Example 61.2.2 (Free and forgetful functors)
Note that these are both informal terms, and don't have a rigid definition.

(a) We talked about a forgetful functor earlier, which takes the underlying set of a category like Vectk. Let's call it U: Vectk → Set.
Now, given a map T: V1 → V2 in Vectk, there is an obvious U(T): U(V1) → U(V2) which is just the set-theoretic map corresponding to T.
Similarly there are forgetful functors from Grp, CRing, etc., to Set. There is even a forgetful functor CRing → Grp: send a ring R to the abelian group (R,+). The common theme is that we are "forgetting" structure from the original category.

(b) We also talked about a free functor in the example. A free functor F: Set → Vectk can be taken by considering F(S) to be the vector space with basis S.
Now, given a map f: S → T, what is the obvious map F(S) → F(T)? Simple: take each basis element s ∈ S to the basis element f(s) ∈ T.
Similarly, we can define F: Set → Grp by taking the free group generated by a set S.

Remark 61.2.3 — There is also a notion of "injective" and "surjective" for functors (on arrows) as follows. A functor F: A → B is faithful (resp. full) if for any A1, A2, F: HomA(A1, A2) → HomB(FA1, FA2) is injective (resp. surjective).
We can use this to give an exact definition of concrete category: it's a category with a faithful (forgetful) functor U: A → Set.

"Again, experts might object that HomA(A1, A2) or HomB(FA1, FA2) may be proper classes instead of sets, but I am assuming everything is locally small.

之前很多次提到了 concrete category 都沒去理它。直觉上就是比较符合认识的对象组成的Cat. 像Grp. Cring,首先obj都是基于集合的对象,然后Mor就是一般脑子里想到的mapping。
标准定义就是说,对于 concrete cat.中两个obj之间的arrow,都唯一对应着Set中这两个obj的underlying sets之间的态射;这是显然的(从例子来看),很显然无论如何元素对应关系,preserve. 至于forgetful,这更显然,

Example 61.2.4 (Functors from G)
Let G be a group and G = {*} be the associated one-object category.

(a) Consider a functor F: G → Set, and let S = F(*). Then the data of F corresponds to putting a group action of G on S.

G:
G
F
→ Set
F(e)
F(a)
F(a₂)

不妨看作右群作用。HomG(*, *) = G's underlying set = {e, a₁, a₂,...}
HomSet C(S,S) = {F(e), F(a₁), F(a₂),...} → 映射的集合

那么对于某个后群作用 α: S × G → S, (x, a) ↦ x ⋅ a (x ∈ S, a ∈ G), 可以视为:
x, a) ↦ (F(a))(x), 又易知 F(e) = ids, 那么 (x, e) ↦ (F(e))(x), i.e. ids(x) = x,
结合群作用条件, Cresp. 左群作用, 因此 F 可看作一个群作用。

(c) Let H be a group and construct H the same way. Then functors G → H
correspond to homomorphisms G → H.

接上一问根还是很直说的。唯一要想的就是保证 δ(a₁ xg a₂) = δ(a₁) XH δ(a₂)
Gaord, 我突然想起来 functor 的定义:

*   The functor respects composition: if A₁ → A₂ → A₃ are arrows in A, then
    F(g ∘ f) = F(g) ∘ F(f).

那这太显然了, 毕竟群视为 Cat., 元素的 x 就是复合, functor 导出的 δ 肯定是同态。

明天要起早, 就此打住。(离 natural trans. 还有距离, 唉)
