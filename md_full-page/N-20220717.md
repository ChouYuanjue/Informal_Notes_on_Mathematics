今天上数列。等闲下来就去学生成函数来做数列题
最常见的问题，递推公式和通项公式的转换

1. 已知{an}通项为an=2^(n+3^n), 验证其满足递推
an+2=5an+1-6an (n≥1)
解: 2^(n+2)+3^(n+2)-5(2^(n+1)+3^(n+1))+6(2^n+3^n)
=(2^2-5×2+6)×2^n+(3^2-5×3+6)×3^n
=0
成立

2. 上n级台阶，一次只能上一层or两层台阶，设
上台阶的方法种数为an, 求{an}的递推公式。
解: 思路:如何走到第n阶，分为两种可能
①先走到n-1层，再走一级到n层→有an-1种
②先走到n-2层，再走2级到n层→有an-2种
∴an=an-1+an-2
(也可以用组合数硬解)

3. 已知某等差数列第二项为5,第5项为11,求其通项公式
解: ① a2=a1+d=5
a5=a1+4d=11
=> d=2
a1=3
② a2+a5=a3+a4=2a3.5=2(a3+1/2d)
=16 ∴a3+1/2d=8 ∴a3+1/2d=8, d=2
4. 一个有限项等差数列前三项和34,后三项和146,各项
之和为390,求等差数列的项数。
解: a1+a2+a3=3a+3d=34
an-2+an-1+an=3a+(2n-6)d=146
na1+n(n-1)/2 d=390
似乎方程很难解所以我的换一种方法
a1+a2+a3=34 => a1+an=60
an-2+an-1+an=146
Sn=a1+...+an=n/2(a1+an)=390
∴n=13

等差数列:从第二项开始,数列的每一项与前一项的差 5. 对于等差数列{an},设前n项和为Sn。若S13<0,
均为一个固定的常数,这个常数称为公差,用d表示 S12>0,则数列中绝对值最小为第几项?
递推公式: an+1=an+d
通项公式: an=a1+(n-1)d
an-an-1=d
累加法
an-an-2=d => an-a1=(n-1)d
...
a2-a1=d

等差数列前n项和: Sn=∑ak=na1+n(n-1)/2 d
Sn=a1+(a1+d)+(a1+2d)+...+(a1+(n-1)d)
=na1+n(n-1)/2 d

若x1+x2=y1+y2=m, 则ax1+ax2=ay1+ay2
ax1+ax2=a1+(x1-1)d+a1+(x2-1)d
=2a1+(m-2)d
同理ay1+ay2=2a1+(m-2)d
↓
若x1+x2+...+xk=y1+y2+...+yk=m
则ax1+ax2+...+axk=ay1+ay2+...+ayk

解: S13=13a7<0 => a7<0
S12=6(a1+a12)>0 => 6(a6+a7)>0
∴a6>0 d<0
∴|a1|>|a2|>...<|a11|
|a7|<|a8|<...
∴a6+a7>0 => |a6|>|a7|
∴最小为第7项。

等比数列:从第二项开始,数列的每一项与前一项的比
均为一个固定的常数,这个常数称为公比,用q表示
递推公式: an+1=qan
通项公式: an=a1.q^(n-1)
an/an-1=q
累乘法
an-1/an-2=q
...
a2/a1=q

累乘法和累加法中d,q不一定相等,
我们常用这两种方法求各种通项公式

例: a₁=1, aₙ=2aₙ₋₁+1, 求通项
① 转化成果乘
aₙ₊₁ = 2(aₙ₋₁+1) ∴ bₙ=2bₙ₋₁
bₙ bₙ₋₁
∴ bₙ = 2ⁿ b₁ = 2ⁿ a₁ = 2ⁿ⁻¹

② 转化成果加
aₙ = aₙ₋₁ + 1/n ∴ bₙ = bₙ₋₁ + 1/n
bₙ bₙ₋₁
∴ bₙ - b₁ = 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n
= Σ(1/n+1 - 1/n) - 1/2
= 1 - 1/n
∴ bₙ = 1 - 1/n ∴ aₙ = 2ⁿ⁻¹
这里用了等比数列求和公式

等比数列求和公式
Sₙ = Σ aₖ = {na₁, q=1
a₁(qⁿ-1)/(q-1), q≠1

好, 接下来我们推进Napkin
§1.1 Definition and examples of groups
Prototypical example for this section: The additive group of integers (Z,+) and the cyclic
group Z/mZ. Just don't let yourself forget that most groups are non-commutative.

Definition 1.1.3. A group is a pair G = (G, *) consisting of a set of elements G, and
a binary operation * on G, such that:

• G has an identity element, usually denoted 1G or just 1, with the property that
1G * g = g * 1G = g for all g ∈ G.

• The operation is associative, meaning (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for any a, b, c ∈ G.
Consequently we generally don't write the parentheses.

• Each element g ∈ G has an inverse, that is, an element h ∈ G such that
注意, 逆元是唯一的
g * h = h * g = 1G.

Remark 1.1.4 (Unimportant pedantic point) — Some authors like to add a "closure"
axiom, i.e. to say explicitly that g * h ∈ G. This is implied already by the fact that
* is a binary operation on G, but is worth keeping in mind for the examples below.

Remark 1.1.5 — It is not required that * is commutative (a * b = b * a). So we say
that a group is abelian if the operation is commutative and non-abelian otherwise.

推导: (L941)
Sₙ = a₁ + q a₁ + q² a₁ + ... + qⁿ⁻¹ a₁
q Sₙ = q a₁ + q² a₁ + ... + qⁿ a₁
∴ (q-1) Sₙ = (qⁿ - 1) a₁
Sₙ = a₁ (qⁿ - 1) / (q - 1)

例: aₙ = n aₙ₋₁ + 1, a₁ = 1, 求通项
解: aₙ / n! = aₙ₋₁ / (n-1)! + 1/n!
∴ bₙ = bₙ₋₁ + 1/n!
∴ bₙ = 1 + (1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n!)
aₙ = n! + (n-1)! + ... + 1

Example 1.1.6 (Non-Examples of groups)
• The pair (Q, ·) is NOT a group. (Here Q is rational numbers.) While there is an identity element, the element 0 ∈ Q does not have an inverse.
• The pair (Z, ·) is also NOT a group. (Why?) Don't have an inverse.
• Let Mat2x2(R) be the set of 2 × 2 real matrices. Then (Mat2x2(R), ·) (where · is matrix multiplication) is NOT a group. Indeed, even though we have an identity matrix
we still run into the same issue as before: the zero matrix does not have a multiplicative inverse.
(Even if we delete the zero matrix from the set, the resulting structure is still not a group: those of you that know some linear algebra might recall that any matrix with determinant zero cannot have an inverse.)

Example 1.1.7 (Complex unit circle)
Let S¹ denote the set of complex numbers z with absolute value one; that is
S¹ := {z ∈ C | |z| = 1}.
Then (S¹, x) is a group because
• The complex number 1 ∈ S¹ serves as the identity, and
• Each complex number z ∈ S¹ has an inverse 1/z which is also in S¹, since |z⁻¹| = |z|⁻¹ = 1.
There is one thing I ought to also check: that z₁ × z₂ is actually still in S¹. But this follows from the fact that |z₁z₂| = |z₁||z₂| = 1.

Example 1.1.8 (Addition mod n)
Here is an example from number theory: Let n > 1 be an integer, and consider the residues (remainders) modulo n. These form a group under addition. We call this the cyclic group of order n, and denote it as Z/nZ, with elements 0, 1,.... The identity is 0.

同余等价类。我感觉这块难起来还得等讲到有限城的时候,那个国式分解有点哈人。不过估计李学到那也不觉得难了。

Example 1.1.9 (Multiplication mod p)
Let p be a prime. Consider the nonzero residues modulo p, which we denote by (Z/pZ)×. Then ((Z/pZ)×, x) is a group.

## 第 4 页

我怀疑上次看此问题可能我没看到这个nonzero residues,现在精quite easy.

Question 1.1.10. Why do we need the fact that p is prime?

解:若不然,令其为ab, (ZZ/abz)*={1,2,..., ab}, ab = 0 (Z/ab 2)*)不满足群的封闭性((2/abⅡ)*,x)不是群。

Example 1.1.11 (General linear group)
Let n be a positive integer. Then GLn(R) is defined as the set of n x n real matrices which have nonzero determinant. It turns out that with this condition, every matrix does indeed have an inverse, so (GLn(R), x) is a group, called the general linear group.
(The fact that GLn(R) is closed under follows from the linear algebra fact that det(AB) = det Adet B, proved in later chapters.)

也就是不会出现行列式为加的情况

Example 1.1.12 (Special linear group)
Following the example above, let SLn(R) denote the set of n x n matrices whose determinant is actually 1. Again, for linear algebra reasons it turns out that (SLn(R), x) is also a group, called the special linear group.

Example 1.1.13 (Symmetric groups)
Let Sn be the set of permutations of {1,..., n}. By viewing these permutations as functions from {1,..., n} to itself, we can consider compositions of permutations. Then the pair (Sn,) (here is function composition) is also a group, because
• There is an identity permutation, and
• Each permutation has an inverse.
The group Sn is called the symmetric group on n elements.

这玩意是我最烦的例子之一,特别是让我构造对称一群与二面体群同构代其是不同构的时候
关于置换常用两套符号,一套是非常直观的:(以{1,2,3}为例)
(1 2 3)(1 2 3)(1 2 3)(1 2 3)(1 2 3)(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)(1 3 2)(2 1 3)(2 3 1)(3 2 1)(3 1 2)

另一套稍做恶心一点,是(acaz...an)的形式,满足以下规则:
(a1→a2→a3→...→an)

以上6种情况用这种方式与出来分别是:
(1) (2 3) (1 2) (1 2 3) (1 3) (1 3 2)
好处是计算合成相当方便。比如(1 2 3)小(1 3)=(1 3 2)。(6975),則输入1元输出6
接下来我们来看Dummit上的例子。这个例子犯了典型的错误,见下

Here is a picture of some elements of D10.

Trivia: the dihedral group D12 is my favorite example of a non-abelian group, and is the first group I try for any exam question of the form "find an example...".

For each n ∈ Z+, n ≥ 3 let D2n be the set of symmetries of a regular n-gon, where a symmetry is any rigid motion of the n-gon which can be effected by taking a copy of the n-gon, moving this copy in any fashion in 3-space and then placing the copy back on the original n-gon so it exactly covers it. More precisely, we can describe the

Then each symmetry s can be described uniquely by the corresponding permutation σ of {1, 2, 3, ..., n} where if the symmetry s puts vertex i in the place where vertex j was originally, then σ is the permutation sending i to j. For instance, if s is a rotation of 2π/n radians clockwise about the center of the n-gon, then σ is the permutation sending i to i + 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and σ(n) = 1. Now make D2n into a group by defining st for s, t ∈ D2n to be the symmetry obtained by first applying t then s to the n-gon (note that we are viewing symmetries as functions on the n-gon, so st is just function composition - read as usual from right to left). If s, t effect the permutations σ, τ, respectively on the vertices, then st effects σ ◦ τ. The binary operation on D2n is associative since composition of functions is associative. The identity of D2n is the identity symmetry (which leaves all vertices fixed), denoted by 1, and the inverse of s ∈ D2n is the symmetry which reverses all rigid motions of s (so if s effects permutation σ on the vertices, s−1 effects σ−1). In the next paragraph we show

|D2n| = 2n

and so D2n is called the dihedral group of order 2n. In some texts this group is written Dn; however, D2n (where the subscript gives the order of the group rather than the number of vertices) is more common in the group theory literature.

(1) 1, r, r2, ..., rn−1 are all distinct and rn = 1, so |r| = n.
(2) |s| = 2.
(3) s ≠ ri for any i.
(4) sri ≠ srj, for all 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1 with i ≠ j, so

D2n = {1, r, r2, ..., rn−1, s, sr, sr2, ..., srn−1}

i.e., each element can be written uniquely in the form skri for some k = 0 or 1 and 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

(5) rs = sr−1. [First work out what permutation s effects on (1, 2,...,n) and then work out separately what each side in this equation does to vertices 1 and 2.] This shows in particular that r and s do not commute so that D2n is non-abelian.

(6) ris = sri, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n. [Proceed by induction on i and use the fact that ri+1s = r(ris) together with the preceding calculation.] This indicates how to commute s with powers of r.

9. Prove that D24 and S4 are not isomorphic.

解：首先注意到 |D24| = |S4| = 24，两者之间肯定存在双射，但并不意味着同构。
同样可以构造一个映射 φ: D24 -> S4, r -> (1234), s -> (12), 这里看起来没有问题，因为我们知道 D24 由 <r, s | r^4 = s^2 = 1, sr = r^-1 s> 生成，S4 由 <σ, τ | σ^4 = τ^2 = 1> 生成，r 和 s^2 的结果被保留。
3. 但 sr = r^-1 s 的关系没有被保留，即使对于 r, s ∈ D24, σ, τ ∈ S4, φ(a) * φ(b) = φ(a * b), 这个映射连同态都不是（其实怎么看都充满问题，刚刚那话当我没说）。
一个表明二者不同构的理由是，|r| = 2，而 S4 中元素最高阶为4。另外，比较同阶元素数量是否相等一般是可行的。

Example 1.1.15 (Products of groups)
Let (G, *) and (H, *) be groups. We can define a product group (G × H, ·), as follows. The elements of the group will be ordered pairs (g, h) ∈ G × H. Then
(g1, h1) · (g2, h2) = (g1 * g2, h1 * h2) ∈ G × H
is the group operation.

Example 1.1.17 (Trivial group)
The trivial group, often denoted 0 or 1, is the group with only an identity element.
I will use the notation {1}.

§1.2 Properties of groups
Prototypical example for this section: (Z/pZ)^x is possibly best.

Proposition 1.2.4 (Inverse of products)
Let G be a group, and a, b ∈ G. Then (ab)^-1 = b^-1 a^-1.

Lemma 1.2.5 (Left multiplication is a bijection)
Let G be a group, and pick a g ∈ G. Then the map G -> G given by x -> gx is a bijection.
被称为 cancellation law 消去律 (ac = bc => a = b) (因为是双射)

Example 1.2.7
Let G = (Z/7Z)^x (as in Example 1.1.9) and pick g = 3. The above lemma states that the map x -> 3 * x is a bijection, and we can see this explicitly:

1 * 3 -> 3 (mod 7)
2 * 3 -> 6 (mod 7)
3 * 3 -> 2 (mod 7)
4 * 3 -> 5 (mod 7)
5 * 3 -> 1 (mod 7)
6 * 3 -> 4 (mod 7).

§1.3 Isomorphisms

Prototypical example for this section: Z ≅ 10Z.

Definition 1.3.1. Let G = (G, *) and H = (H, *) be groups. A bijection φ: G → H is called an isomorphism if

φ(g₁ * g₂) = φ(g₁) * φ(g₂) for all g₁, g₂ ∈ G.

If there exists an isomorphism from G to H, then we say G and H are isomorphic and write G ≅ H.

Example 1.3.3 (Primitive roots modulo 7)

As a nontrivial example, we claim that Z/6Z ≅ (Z/7Z)ˣ. The bijection is

φ(a mod 6) = 3ᵃ mod 7.

*   This map is a bijection by explicit calculation:

(3⁰, 3¹, 3², 3³, 3⁴, 3⁵) ≡ (1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5) (mod 7).

(Technically, I should more properly write 3⁰ mod 6 ≡ 1 and so on to be pedantic.)

*   Finally, we need to verify that this map respects the group action. In other words, we want to see that φ(a + b) = φ(a)φ(b) since the operation of Z/6Z is addition while the operation of (Z/7Z)ˣ is multiplication. That's just saying that 3ᵃ⁺ᵇ mod 6 ≡ 3ᵃ mod 6 3ᵇ mod 6 (mod 7), which is true.

a + b mod n ≡ a mod n + b mod n

Example 1.3.4 (Primitive roots)

More generally, for any prime p, there exists an element g ∈ (Z/pZ)ˣ called a primitive root modulo p such that 1, g, g², ..., gᵖ⁻² are all different modulo p. One can show by copying the above proof that

Z/(p - 1)Z ≅ (Z/pZ)ˣ for all primes p.

The example above was the special case p = 7 and g = 3.
