summary: This research introduces discrete Pen-PL Gaussian games as a model for non-cooperative
  communication, particularly in contexts like spam detection where players use randomization
  to evade detection. The study demonstrates that Pen-PL game strategies approximate
  a Gaussian distribution, with optimal "smooth" curve signaling rules under quadratic
  cost functions and multivariate Gaussian processes. It establishes that computing
  socially optimal network placements is NP-hard for all P-PL-G distributions. Experimental
  results show Pen-PL outperforms existing methods in sparse network scenarios, achieving
  high accuracy even with minimal weights, and highlights applications in behavior
  prediction, attack/avoidance path modeling, and optimization via linear and nonlinear
  programming techniques.
