summary: This paper introduces Chunpinative Geometry, a novel geometric framework
  based on the Dual-Complementary Principle (D-C-P) that equates angles with their
  complements. Departing from Euclidean axioms, it integrates tropical geometry, non-Archimedean
  structures, and a reimagined Erlangen program to construct self-consistent complementary
  angle spaces. Key findings include axiomatization of rigid C-spaces, resolution
  of anomalies like the CZL Lemma, and establishment of a complementarity group governing
  transformations. The theory exhibits unique properties such as schizophrenic curvature
  and metric degeneracies, and bridges synthetic geometry with deformation quantization.
  Applications are demonstrated in quantum error correction, crystalline materials,
  algorithmic optimization, and developmental biology, showcasing its interdisciplinary
  impact and paradigm-shifting potential.
