summary: This document presents mathematical exercises and proofs focusing on complex
  numbers and vector spaces. Key topics include finding multiplicative inverses and
  roots in complex numbers, verifying algebraic properties like commutativity and
  associativity in C and Fⁿ, and proving the uniqueness of additive inverses and multiplicative
  identities. It defines vector spaces, demonstrates that (-1)v equals the additive
  inverse -v, and explores whether extended real numbers with infinity form a vector
  space. The text also covers subspaces, providing conditions and examples such as
  sets of continuous or differentiable functions, and sequences with limit zero, noting
  that subspaces must contain the zero vector and be closed under addition and scalar
  multiplication. It concludes by classifying subspaces of R² and R³ as lines and
  planes through the origin.
