summary: This document provides a comparative analysis of axiomatic set theory systems,
  focusing on ZFC, NBG, KM, and NF. It outlines their historical development, motivations
  (e.g., resolving paradoxes like Russell's), and core axioms. Key findings highlight
  ZFC's dominance due to its simplicity and broad applicability, though it struggles
  with proper classes. NBG and KM extend ZFC by introducing classes to handle large
  collections, with KM offering stronger axioms for richer class descriptions. NF
  allows limited self-reference via stratification but faces unresolved consistency
  issues. The document concludes that each system represents a trade-off between intuition
  and rigor, with ongoing debates on consistency, expressiveness, and potential hybrid
  approaches for future research.
