summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering various problems
  in set theory, algebra, and function analysis. Key findings include: for a non-empty
  set A ⊆ {x ≤ 2021, x ∈ N}, the maximum number of elements |A| is 1348, achieved
  when A = {674, 675, ..., 2021}; the condition A ⊆ (C-B) ∪ (B-C) is equivalent to
  A ∩ B ∩ C = ∅; among six distinct real numbers, at most two algebraic expressions
  can simultaneously be positive; sets M = {4n+6m} and N = {10a+8b} are equal; for
  f(x)=ax²+x with value range [4,9], n-m ∈ [4,8√5]; and for T(a) functions, m ≤ 1
  is the maximum lower bound. Conclusions involve proofs, set relations, and function
  properties.'
