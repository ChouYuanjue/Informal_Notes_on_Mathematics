summary: 'This document is a collection of informal mathematical notes focusing on
  high school-level set theory, functions, and related problems. Key topics include:
  calculation of subset numbers using power sets (|2^A| = 2^|A|), De Morgan''s laws,
  inclusion-exclusion principles, and set representation examples. It explores properties
  of specific sets (e.g., A = {a | a = x² - y²}), mappings, and functions, including
  injectivity, surjectivity, and periodic points. Numerous solved problems illustrate
  concepts such as Venn diagrams, function equations, inequalities, domains, and extremal
  values. Conclusions often derive from logical deductions or algebraic manipulations,
  emphasizing foundational techniques in combinatorics, algebra, and real analysis.
  The notes are practice-oriented, with examples ranging from basic set operations
  to advanced functional equations.'
