summary: This document presents informal mathematical notes covering calculus, differential
  equations, and linear algebra. Key topics include the Faà di Bruno formula for higher
  derivatives of composite functions, Leibniz notation manipulations for differentials
  (e.g., dy, d²y), and matrix algebra concepts such as matrix multiplication properties
  (non-commutativity, associativity), block matrix operations for efficient computation,
  and Schur complements for elimination. An example computes a specific inverse matrix
  element (b₃₃=524800) using block matrix diagonalization. The notes reference advanced
  texts but focus on practical problem-solving, skipping foundational sections for
  brevity.
