summary: 'This document provides informal notes on matrix inverses and rotation matrices
  in linear algebra. Key points include: a matrix is invertible if and only if it
  has n pivots or a non-zero determinant, with uniqueness of the inverse and solutions
  to Ax=b and Ax=0 highlighted. Specific formulas for 2x2 and diagonal matrix inverses
  are given, alongside properties like (AB)⁻¹=B⁻¹A⁻¹. Two methods for computing inverses
  are discussed: the adjugate matrix approach (A⁻¹=1/|A| A*) and Gaussian elimination.
  The notes also cover rotation matrices, deriving Rθ for planar rotations about the
  origin using basis vectors and linear combinations, and clarify that rotations about
  arbitrary points are not linear transformations. Overall, the document summarizes
  fundamental concepts and computational techniques for matrix inverses and rotations.'
