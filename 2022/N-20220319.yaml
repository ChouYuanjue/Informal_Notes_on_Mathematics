summary: 'This document provides an informal review of calculus concepts, focusing
  on sequences, limits, derivatives, and integration. It defines sequences and their
  convergence using the ε-N definition, illustrated with an example proving lim n/(n+1)=1.
  It introduces limits of functions via the ε-δ definition, emphasizing behavior near
  but not at a point. Derivatives are defined as rates of change, with explanations
  of O and o notations for asymptotic behavior. Key differentiation rules are covered:
  chain, product, quotient, and Leibniz''s rule for higher derivatives. Integration
  is presented as a limit of sums, approximating area under curves, and the Fundamental
  Theorem of Calculus is stated and proved, showing differentiation and integration
  are inverse operations. The notes conclude with a concise proof of the theorem.'
