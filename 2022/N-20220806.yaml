summary: 'This document is a collection of informal mathematical notes dated August
  6, 2022, focusing on set theory, number theory, and algebraic problems. Key topics
  include defining and manipulating sets (e.g., Example 1: B = {-2, -3} with sum -5),
  proving closure properties under addition and subtraction (Example 2), and determining
  maximum subset sizes under divisibility constraints (Example 3: |M| ≤ 21). It explores
  functional equations (Example 4: A ⊆ B for f(x) = x² + ax + b), combinatorial arguments
  (Example 6: sums as perfect squares), and constructive proofs (Example 8: existence
  of subset T). Exercises cover solving systems, set intersections, inequalities,
  and modular arithmetic, with conclusions like the non-existence of certain parameters
  (A4) and optimal set constructions (A11: max |S| = 44). The notes emphasize proof
  techniques, counterexamples, and bounds, often using contradiction and induction.'
