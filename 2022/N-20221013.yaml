summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering three main topics:
  polygon area calculation using the shoelace formula, polynomial remainder theorem
  and applications, and modular arithmetic including congruence properties and Euler''s
  theorem. Key findings include: the polygon area formula derivation with an example
  calculation; the polynomial remainder theorem proof and its application to finding
  remainders when dividing by quadratic factors; and modular arithmetic concepts demonstrating
  that nÂ² mod values are restricted (0,1 for mod 3/4; 0,1,4 for mod 8), the digit-sum
  congruence property mod 9, and Euler''s theorem applications for computing remainders
  of large powers. The document concludes with solved problems illustrating these
  concepts, such as finding maximum values of trigonometric expressions related to
  circle geometry and computing remainders of large numbers modulo primes.'
