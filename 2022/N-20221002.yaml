summary: This document presents informal notes on mathematics, focusing on field theory
  and finite fields. It covers the definition and properties of fields, including
  examples like ℂ, ℚ, and ℝ, and discusses field extensions, such as ℂ/ℝ. The notes
  detail finite fields F_p of prime order and their polynomial rings, explaining constructions
  like F_p[x]/(f(x)) to create fields of order p^n. Factorization of polynomials over
  finite fields is explored, including irreducibility criteria and algorithms like
  Berlekamp and Cantor-Zassenhaus. The Frobenius endomorphism and its role in field
  theory are highlighted, along with methods for determining polynomial roots and
  factorization in extensions. The document concludes with a brief calculus example,
  illustrating the derivative definition. Overall, it provides a concise overview
  of key concepts in algebra related to fields and polynomials.
