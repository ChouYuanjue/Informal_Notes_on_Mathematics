summary: This document provides informal notes on calculus, focusing on derivatives.
  It introduces key concepts such as difference quotients, limits, and derivative
  definitions, then systematically derives formulas for derivatives of various functions,
  including polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions, and their inverses.
  Examples illustrate applications, such as finding tangent lines and proving derivative
  rules like the product, quotient, and chain rules. The notes conclude with derivatives
  of inverse trigonometric functions, highlighting mathematical rigor and potential
  ambiguities in sign conventions.
