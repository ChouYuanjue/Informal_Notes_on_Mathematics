summary: This document is a set of informal mathematics lecture notes focusing on
  set theory and combinatorial principles. Key topics include summation and product
  notations, De Morgan's laws, the inclusion-exclusion principle, pigeonhole principle,
  addition and multiplication principles, permutations, combinations, binomial theorem,
  and properties of subsets. It provides proofs and examples, such as calculating
  intersections, set operations, and solving problems involving integer sets and functions.
  The notes conclude with exercises demonstrating applications of these concepts,
  including proofs of irrationality and combinatorial identities.
