summary: This document presents a summary and translation of Tom Leinster's "Rethinking
  Set Theory," which introduces the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (ETCS)
  as an alternative to Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC).
  ETCS uses functions as a primitive concept, defining elements as functions from
  a terminal set, and includes ten axioms covering composition, terminal and empty
  sets, Cartesian products, function sets, inverse images, subset classifiers, natural
  numbers, and the axiom of choice. It argues that ETCS aligns better with mathematicians'
  intuitive use of sets, avoids ZFC's issues (like requiring all elements to be sets),
  and is equally expressive when augmented with an eleventh axiom (replacement). The
  approach is elementary, avoiding advanced category theory, and aims to provide a
  more natural foundation for most mathematical practice.
