summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering three main topics:
  (1) Fréchet differentiability and complex differentiability, demonstrating through
  directional limits that f(z)=conjugate(z) is not differentiable and linking Fréchet
  differentiability to Cauchy-Riemann conditions; (2) Hessian matrices and Taylor
  expansions for constrained optimization, including a theorem on bordered Hessian
  criteria for local maxima and an applied example proving √ab+√bc+√ca-√abc≥2 under
  a+b+c=ab+bc+ca using Lagrange multipliers and Hessian analysis at a=b=c=1; (3) polynomial
  factorization over finite fields and Galois theory, with observations on GF(p) arithmetic
  and examples of polynomial behavior in different fields. The notes reflect exploratory
  learning with practical examples and unresolved questions for future study.'
