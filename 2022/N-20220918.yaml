summary: 'This document presents two mathematical proofs: first, it demonstrates that
  for any natural number n, 512 divides the expression 3^(2n) - 32nÂ² + 24n - 1 by
  reducing the problem through successive differences and showing divisibility by
  8 for a base case. Second, it proves that for the alternating harmonic series up
  to 1/1319 expressed as p/q in lowest terms, p is divisible by the prime number 1979
  by regrouping terms into pairs whose numerators are multiples of 1979 and leveraging
  coprimality. Both proofs utilize algebraic manipulation, properties of divisibility,
  and number theory concepts.'
