summary: 'This document provides an introduction to elliptic curves (ECs), defined
  by equations of the form y² = x³ + ax + b, emphasizing that valid ECs must avoid
  double or triple roots, ensured by the condition 4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0. It outlines proofs
  for this criterion and introduces elliptic curve arithmetic, defining a group operation
  via geometric point addition: for distinct points, the sum is found by drawing a
  line through them, finding its third intersection with the curve, and reflecting
  across the x-axis, with formulas derived using slopes and Vieta’s theorem. Point
  doubling (adding a point to itself) uses tangent slopes from implicit differentiation.
  The summary includes handling the special case of vertical lines by introducing
  a point at infinity (∞) to ensure closure, making ECs suitable for cryptographic
  applications like group-based cryptosystems.'
