summary: 'This document contains informal mathematical notes focusing on combinatorial
  set theory, geometric sequences, mathematical induction, and inequalities. Key findings
  include: a combinatorial problem (B17) determining the maximum number of sets (871)
  with specific intersection properties; a number theory problem (B18) constructing
  a maximal subset modulo 11; solutions to geometric sequence problems (e.g., finding
  terms, sums, and common ratios); and examples of mathematical induction proofs,
  including divisibility and sequence formulas. The notes also cover principles of
  induction, bounded sequences, and pattern identification in series. Conclusions
  emphasize problem-solving techniques, formula derivations, and inductive reasoning
  in various mathematical contexts.'
