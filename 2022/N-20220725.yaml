summary: This document presents informal mathematics notes on determinants, focusing
  on calculating inversion numbers and determinant properties. Key topics include
  inversion number computation for permutations (e.g., Ï„(426315)=8), determinant sign
  determination based on inversion parity, and properties such as transpose invariance,
  sign change with row swaps, scalar factoring, additive splitting, and row operations.
  Methods for determinant calculation are demonstrated, including the diagonal rule
  (for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices) and triangulation. Examples illustrate zero-value cases
  (e.g., proportional rows) and practical computations, with exercises reinforcing
  concepts like inversion numbers and determinant evaluation. Errors in row operation
  applications are noted, emphasizing proper elementary transformations.
