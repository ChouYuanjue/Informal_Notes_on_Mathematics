summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering advanced geometry
  and trigonometry topics. Key geometric lemmas include: Lemma 1.17 proves that reflecting
  a triangle''s orthocenter over a side places it on the circumcircle, and reflecting
  over the midpoint makes the corresponding line a diameter. Lemma 1.18 establishes
  properties of incenter/excenter reflections showing concyclic points and exterior
  angle bisectors. The notes introduce directed angles modulo 180Â° with nine fundamental
  properties and applications, including proving Miquel''s Theorem for concurrent
  circles. Vector operations and identities are covered, along with comprehensive
  trigonometric formulas: basic definitions, Pythagorean identities, reduction formulas,
  angle addition/subtraction rules, and product-to-sum/sum-to-product transformations.
  The material blends geometric proofs with algebraic techniques, emphasizing directed
  angles for handling complex configurations.'
