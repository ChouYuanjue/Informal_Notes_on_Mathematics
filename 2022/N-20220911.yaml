summary: 'This document provides a comprehensive summary of formulas and concepts
  related to lines and circles in coordinate geometry. Key topics covered include:
  slope and inclination angle formulas; conditions for parallel and perpendicular
  lines; five forms of linear equations (point-slope, slope-intercept, two-point,
  intercept, and general); direction and normal vectors; vector-based equations; angle
  formulas between lines; distance formulas (between points, point to line, and parallel
  lines); and four types of line families (fixed-point, concurrent, parallel, and
  perpendicular). It also introduces circle equations (standard and general forms)
  and discusses line-circle and circle-circle positional relationships, including
  geometric and algebraic criteria. Several examples illustrate applications, such
  as range determination under constraints, maximum distance calculations, and geometric
  problem-solving involving triangles and curves. The document serves as a condensed
  reference for fundamental principles in two-dimensional analytic geometry.'
