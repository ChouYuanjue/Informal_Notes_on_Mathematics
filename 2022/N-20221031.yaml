summary: This document presents informal notes on elementary number theory, focusing
  on divisibility properties and theorems. Key concepts covered include the definition
  of divisibility, properties such as reflexivity and transitivity, the division algorithm,
  greatest common divisors (GCD), least common multiples (LCM), and Bézout's identity,
  which states that for integers \(a\) and \(b\), there exist integers \(s\) and \(t\)
  such that \(as + bt = \gcd(a,b)\). Advanced properties explore relationships like
  \(\gcd(a,b)=1\) and \(a \mid bc\) implying \(a \mid c\), and formulas such as \(\gcd(a^m
  - 1, a^n - 1) = a^{\gcd(m,n)} - 1\). The document includes proofs using mathematical
  induction and provides illustrative examples and exercises, such as demonstrating
  divisibility conditions, computing GCDs of expressions like \(2^{200}-1\) and \(2^{88}-1\),
  and solving problems involving integer triples where sums plus one are divisible
  by the third number. Conclusions affirm foundational results and specific integer
  solutions, reinforcing the applicability of divisibility theory in problem-solving.
