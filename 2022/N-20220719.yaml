summary: This document presents informal notes on solid geometry, covering fundamental
  axioms, definitions, and theorems related to spatial relationships among points,
  lines, and planes. Key axioms establish conditions for plane uniqueness and intersections.
  Definitions classify positional relationships between lines (coplanar intersecting,
  parallel, or skew) and between lines and planes (contained, intersecting, or parallel).
  Theorems address parallelism and perpendicularity, including criteria for line-plane
  and plane-plane parallelism, properties of parallel lines, and angle relationships
  when sides are parallel. It introduces concepts like line-plane angles, projections,
  the three-perpendicular theorem, and the three-cosine theorem. Dihedral angles and
  their measures are defined, along with criteria and properties for perpendicular
  planes. Examples test understanding of geometric propositions, and distance definitions
  for points, parallel entities, and skew lines are provided. The notes conclude with
  a proof involving a regular hexagon in a cube and perpendicularity.
