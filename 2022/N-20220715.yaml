summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering two main topics:
  conic sections and the construction of real numbers via Dedekind cuts. For conic
  sections, it defines ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas, detailing their standard
  equations, foci, axes, eccentricity, and geometric properties, including derivations
  and proofs such as maximizing âˆ F1PF2 in ellipses. The second part focuses on Dedekind
  cuts to construct real numbers, defining order relations, addition operations, and
  verifying algebraic axioms (associativity, commutativity, etc.), with proofs for
  properties like density of rationals/irrationals and the existence of additive inverses.
  The notes emphasize rigorous definitions and proofs, linking concepts to foundational
  real analysis and linear spaces.'
