summary: This document presents informal notes on algebraic topology and algebra,
  focusing on topological constructions and group theory. Key topics include the disjoint
  union and wedge sum of topological spaces, with examples like S¹ ∨ S¹ forming a
  figure eight. It introduces CW complexes, detailing their construction through skeletons
  and cells, and provides examples such as Sⁿ and D². The torus and Klein bottle are
  described as CW complexes with specific attaching words (aba⁻¹b⁻¹ and abab⁻¹, respectively).
  Additionally, group theory concepts are covered, including congruence modulo a subgroup,
  cosets, and the index of a subgroup, with proofs and properties discussed. The notes
  blend geometric intuition with formal definitions, emphasizing foundational structures
  in algebraic topology and algebra.
