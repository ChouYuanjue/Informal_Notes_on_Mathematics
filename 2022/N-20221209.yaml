summary: 'This document presents informal mathematics lecture notes covering several
  exercises on number theory, set theory, and combinatorics. Key topics include: counting
  composite numbers and primes up to 120 using inclusion-exclusion; applying the inclusion-exclusion
  principle to set combinations; analyzing quadratic equations with real roots; proving
  the irrationality of âˆš2; demonstrating properties of power sets through induction;
  solving systems of equations; and proving that among 1999 sets each of size 45,
  there exists a common element, with conclusions on union sizes. The exercises employ
  mathematical reasoning, proofs by contradiction, and combinatorial arguments, showcasing
  fundamental concepts in discrete mathematics.'
