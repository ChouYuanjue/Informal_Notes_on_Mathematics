summary: This document presents informal notes on complex analysis, focusing on holomorphic
  functions and contour integrals. It explains that holomorphic functions are exceptionally
  well-behaved, with properties including that contour integrals over loops are zero,
  they are determined by their Taylor series, and minimal data (like boundary values
  or a sequence of points) can specify the entire function. The text defines contour
  integrals, illustrates their computation with an example involving the unit circle
  (showing ∫ z^m dz is 2πi only for m = -1 and zero otherwise), and discusses their
  geometric interpretation via Riemann sums. It concludes with the Cauchy-Goursat
  theorem, stating that for a holomorphic function in a simply connected domain, the
  contour integral over any loop is zero.
