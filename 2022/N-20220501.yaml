summary: This document presents informal notes on mathematical concepts, focusing
  primarily on optimization techniques using Lagrange multipliers and Hessian matrices.
  It introduces the Lagrangian function for constrained optimization, demonstrates
  its application through examples such as minimizing \(x^2 + y^2\) subject to \(x
  + y = 1\), and explains the use of Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The notes detail the
  Hessian matrix for second-order partial derivatives, its role in determining local
  minima (e.g., via Sylvester's criterion), and extend to bordered Hessians for constrained
  problems. Additional topics include Taylor expansions, derivative fundamentals,
  and a MATLAB example for eigenvalue computation of a Hessian. The content is pedagogical,
  emphasizing theoretical foundations and practical computations in multivariable
  calculus and optimization.
