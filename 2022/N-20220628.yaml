summary: This document presents informal notes on integration techniques in mathematics,
  focusing on methods such as term-by-term integration, partial fractions, integration
  by parts, and substitution (both first and second types). Key examples include integrating
  rational functions, trigonometric integrals, and irrational expressions, with detailed
  step-by-step solutions and occasional reflections on errors or alternative approaches.
  The notes emphasize practical problem-solving strategies, including handling repeated
  factors in denominators, choosing substitutions for simplification, and applying
  standard trigonometric substitutions for expressions involving square roots.
