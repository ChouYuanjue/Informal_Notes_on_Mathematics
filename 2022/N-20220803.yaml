summary: This document presents a collection of mathematical problems and solutions
  focused on arithmetic and geometric sequences, as well as trigonometric applications
  in triangles. Key topics include determining triangle properties using logarithmic
  and trigonometric identities (e.g., Example 121 concludes the triangle is isosceles),
  verifying and analyzing arithmetic and geometric sequences (e.g., Examples 122–124,
  132), solving for sums, terms, and ratios in sequences (e.g., Examples 123, 126–131),
  and finding parameter constraints (e.g., Example 128 derives d ∈ (-∞, -1-2√5] ∪
  [2√5, +∞)). Conclusions involve specific values, such as k ≤ -10 in Example 125
  and x = 18 in Example 132, alongside general insights into sequence behaviors and
  properties.
