summary: This document presents informal mathematical notes focused on inequalities,
  covering fundamental inequalities such as the basic inequality (a² + b² ≥ 2ab),
  AM-GM inequality (arithmetic mean-geometric mean), Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in
  two and three dimensions, and the triangle inequality (including absolute value
  and vector forms). It includes proofs and applications, demonstrating techniques
  for establishing inequalities like (a+b+c)/3 ≥ ³√abc and (a+b+c+d)/4 ≥ ⁴√abcd, as
  well as solving problems involving constraints (e.g., a+b+c=1) and maximizing expressions
  under given conditions. Examples illustrate the use of inequalities in various contexts,
  with proofs relying on algebraic manipulation, mean inequalities, and properties
  like equality conditions. The document concludes with geometric interpretations
  and cautionary notes on applying the triangle inequality effectively. Key findings
  confirm the validity of these inequalities under specified conditions, with equality
  cases identified where applicable.
