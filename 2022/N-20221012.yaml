summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering several fundamental
  inequalities: Bernoulli''s inequality (for products of terms with xi > -1), power
  mean inequality (monotonicity of Mr(a) in r), Cauchy''s inequality and its corollaries
  (including weighted sum and triangle-type forms), Chebyshev''s inequality (for ordered
  sequences), Jensen''s inequality (for convex functions, stating function of mean
  ≤ mean of functions), Hölder''s inequality (generalizing Cauchy with exponents p,q
  > 1, including Young''s inequality), and Minkowski''s inequality (two forms for
  p-norms of sums). Each inequality is defined with conditions, mathematical expressions,
  and equality cases, focusing on real numbers and sequences, primarily serving as
  a reference for properties and applications in mathematical analysis.'
