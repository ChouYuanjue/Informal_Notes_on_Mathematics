summary: This document presents informal mathematical notes focusing on divisibility
  in integers. It defines divisibility and lists key theorems, such as properties
  of divisibility relations and the condition |a| ≤ |b| when a divides b. Examples
  demonstrate solving divisibility problems using techniques like polynomial reduction
  and inequality analysis. A specific problem proves that the sum of powers 1¹⁹⁸³
  + 2¹⁹⁸³ + ... + 1983¹⁹⁸³ is divisible by the sum 1+2+...+1983, utilizing pairing
  strategies and divisibility properties. The conclusions emphasize applying divisibility
  conditions and algebraic manipulations to establish results.
