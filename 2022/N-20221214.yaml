summary: 'This document discusses Tarski''s circle-squaring problem, which asks whether
  a disk and square of equal area in the plane are equidecomposable by isometries.
  It contrasts this with dissection congruence in polygons (resolved by the Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwein
  theorem) and polyhedra (addressed via Dehn invariants). The Banach-Tarski paradox
  and measure theory implications are noted, particularly differences between dimensions.
  Laczkovich''s 1990 affirmative solution is highlighted: using the axiom of choice,
  he proved that bounded sets in R^k with equal positive Lebesgue measure and boundaries
  of upper Minkowski dimension less than k are equidecomposable. His approach involves
  translations on the torus, graph theory, and a refined ergodic theorem leveraging
  Diophantine approximation to ensure nearly uniform distribution of set elements
  in orbits.'
