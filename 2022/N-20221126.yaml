summary: This document provides an informal academic overview of modular arithmetic,
  focusing on congruence relations, residue classes, and Euler's totient function.
  It defines congruence modulo m and outlines fundamental properties such as reflexivity,
  symmetry, transitivity, and operations under addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.
  Key concepts include residue classes, complete residue systems, reduced residue
  classes, and Euler's φ function, with formulas for computing φ(n) based on prime
  factorization. The document includes proofs and examples demonstrating applications,
  such as determining the last digit of large powers, solving linear congruences,
  and addressing classic problems like the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Exercises reinforce
  properties of squares modulo different bases (e.g., squares modulo 4 are 0 or 1)
  and practical problem-solving techniques. Overall, it serves as a concise educational
  resource on foundational number theory topics.
