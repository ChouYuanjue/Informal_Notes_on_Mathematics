summary: 'This document presents informal mathematics notes covering proofs and exercises
  on combinatorics and set theory. Key topics include: a proof of the binomial theorem
  using mathematical induction; a proof that the number of subsets of a set A is 2^|A|;
  and solutions to 13 supplementary exercises involving set properties, inequalities,
  number theory, and combinatorial problems. Main findings include determining set
  sizes, sums, and extremal values, as well as proving properties of subsets under
  specific conditions. Conclusions affirm mathematical identities and establish bounds
  or existence results in set-related problems.'
