summary: This document introduces complex analysis by contrasting pathological real
  functions (e.g., Cantor, Weierstraß, and smooth non-analytic functions) with holomorphic
  functions in complex analysis. It defines complex differentiability, emphasizing
  that the limit must hold from all directions in the complex plane, illustrated by
  the non-holomorphic conjugation function. Holomorphic functions are defined as those
  complex-differentiable everywhere in their domain, with entire functions as a special
  case. Examples include polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions, and their
  combinations via standard rules, highlighting their well-behaved nature compared
  to real functions.
