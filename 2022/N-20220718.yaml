summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering two main topics:
  recurrence sequences and real number construction via Dedekind cuts. For recurrence
  sequences, it details methods for solving linear and fractional recurrence relations
  using fixed-point techniques and characteristic equations, including examples and
  step-by-step derivations. The second part focuses on foundational real analysis,
  proving properties of Dedekind cuts, defining operations on real numbers, and establishing
  results such as the density of rationals and irrationals in intervals. It also includes
  exercises on metric spaces, supremum properties, and the existence of irrational
  numbers like âˆš2, with proofs leveraging axioms and set-theoretic arguments.'
