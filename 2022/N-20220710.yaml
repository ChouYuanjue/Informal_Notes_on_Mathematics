summary: This document presents informal mathematics notes covering vector operations
  in plane geometry, including coordinate representations, dot products, and angle
  calculations, followed by an axiomatic construction of real numbers. It defines
  ℝ as an ordered field satisfying field axioms (F1-F9), order axioms (O1-O5), Archimedes'
  axiom (A), and the nested interval property (I). Key proofs include the uniqueness
  of additive/multiplicative inverses, properties of inequalities, and the embedding
  of rational numbers into ℝ via an injective homomorphism ι:ℚ→ℝ. The notes conclude
  that ℝ, defined by these axioms, contains all rationals and necessitates the nested
  interval axiom to ensure existence of irrationals like √2, while excluding infinitesimals.
  The text emphasizes foundational rigor and highlights limitations in standard secondary
  education treatments of real numbers.
