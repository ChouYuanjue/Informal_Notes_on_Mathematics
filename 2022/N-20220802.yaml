summary: This document provides informal notes on trigonometry, covering fundamental
  concepts such as angles, radian measure, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine,
  tangent), identities (e.g., Pythagorean and angle sum/difference formulas), reduction
  formulas, double-angle and half-angle formulas, and product-to-sum/sum-to-product
  transformations. It also discusses trigonometric function graphs, periodicity, inverse
  trigonometric functions, and applications in solving triangles using the sine and
  cosine laws, along with area formulas including Heron's formula. Examples illustrate
  problem-solving techniques, such as simplifying expressions and determining angle
  ranges based on trigonometric inequalities. The notes conclude with triangle-specific
  identities and relationships among trigonometric ratios in geometric contexts.
