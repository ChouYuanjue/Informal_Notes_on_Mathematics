summary: 'This document presents informal notes on topology, focusing on metric spaces
  and homeomorphisms. Key points include: metric spaces may not be complete (e.g.,
  Q), but can be completed (e.g., Q to R); homeomorphisms require bijective continuous
  functions with continuous inverses, unlike group isomorphisms, and are not preserved
  under metric properties like completeness or boundedness (e.g., (0,1) homeomorphic
  to R but differing in these properties). Examples illustrate homeomorphisms (e.g.,
  torus to coffee cup, (-1,1) to R) and non-homeomorphic continuous bijections. The
  open set condition for continuity is stated and partially proven. Additionally,
  sets in metric spaces can be both open and closed (clopen), demonstrated with M
  = [0,1] âˆª (2,3). The notes emphasize transitioning from metric-based concepts to
  broader topological ideas.'
