summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering two main topics:
  spatial vectors and category theory. The first part defines spatial vectors, their
  properties (length, zero and unit vectors, parallelism), and operations (addition,
  scalar multiplication, dot product). It introduces key theorems on collinear and
  coplanar vectors, vector decomposition, and standard orthogonal bases, along with
  coordinate formulas. The cross product is defined with its properties. The second
  part transitions to category theory, using the universal property to define products
  uniquely up to isomorphism. It explains categories, morphisms, composition, identity,
  and isomorphisms, with examples from sets and vector spaces. Groupoids are discussed
  as categories where all morphisms are isomorphisms, including examples like Rubik''s
  cube (group) and 15-puzzle (groupoid). The notes emphasize abstract definitions
  and their applications across mathematical contexts.'
