summary: This document presents informal mathematical notes containing ten problems
  (A1-A8, B9-B10) primarily focused on inequalities, optimization, and algebraic proofs,
  with extensive use of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and other techniques. Key findings
  include deriving necessary conditions for inequalities (e.g., A2), solving maximization
  problems (A3), proving bounds on triangle angles (A5), and establishing product
  constraints (A7, B9). Conclusions demonstrate equality conditions, such as specific
  variable relationships (A4, A6), and validate inequalities under given constraints
  (B10), emphasizing rigorous mathematical reasoning and problem-solving strategies.
