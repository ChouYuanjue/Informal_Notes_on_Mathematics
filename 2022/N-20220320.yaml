summary: This document presents informal notes on calculus, focusing on the mean value
  theorem and its extensions. It covers Rolle's theorem, the standard mean value theorem,
  and Cauchy's (ratio) mean value theorem, emphasizing conditions for differentiability
  and continuity. The notes highlight that differentiability implies continuity, but
  not vice versa, illustrated by the Weierstrass functionâ€”a continuous yet nowhere
  differentiable function defined by an infinite cosine series, demonstrating counterintuitive
  mathematical concepts.
