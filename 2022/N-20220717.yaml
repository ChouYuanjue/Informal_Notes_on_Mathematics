summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering two main topics:
  sequences and group theory. For sequences, it discusses converting recurrence relations
  to closed-form expressions, solving problems involving arithmetic and geometric
  sequences, and deriving formulas for sums and specific terms. Examples include verifying
  recurrence relations, solving step-counting problems, and determining properties
  of finite sequences. In group theory, it defines groups, provides examples (cyclic,
  dihedral, symmetric, linear groups) and non-examples, and explores properties like
  inverses, associativity, and isomorphisms. Key findings include proofs of group
  properties, demonstrations of non-isomorphism (e.g., D24 and S4), and isomorphisms
  like Z/(p-1)Z ≅ (Z/pZ)× for primes. Conclusions emphasize foundational techniques
  in sequences and group axioms, with practical applications in problem-solving.'
