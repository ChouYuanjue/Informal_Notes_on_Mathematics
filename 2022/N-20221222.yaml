summary: 'This document presents informal notes on topology, focusing on redefining
  metric concepts using open sets in topological spaces. Key topics include continuity
  defined via pre-images of open sets, homeomorphisms as bijections preserving open
  sets, and closed sets with closures. It highlights limitations: completeness and
  boundedness are metric-specific and not topological, sequences behave poorly, and
  non-metrizable spaces exist. Separation axioms are introduced, emphasizing Hausdorff
  spaces where distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods. Subspace topology is defined
  via intersections. Connectedness is characterized by absence of nontrivial clopen
  sets, with examples of disconnected (e.g., discrete spaces, rationals) and connected
  sets (e.g., intervals). Path-connectedness, a stronger notion, requires continuous
  paths between points and implies connectedness, with examples like R² and S¹. Conclusions
  note that while many metric ideas generalize, some properties are inherently metric-dependent.'
