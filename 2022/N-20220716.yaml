summary: This document presents informal mathematics notes focusing on conic sections,
  specifically the positional relationships between lines and ellipses, parabolas,
  and hyperbolas. Key topics include determining intersection points (0, 1, or 2)
  through solving quadratic equations derived from line-conic systems, distinguishing
  between tangency and intersection cases, and solving applied problems involving
  distances, areas, and parameter ranges. Examples illustrate methods for finding
  tangent lines, calculating maximum areas (e.g., △PAB area up to 20√5), and determining
  constraints like k > 1 or k < -1 for line-ellipse intersections. The notes emphasize
  algebraic techniques, such as discriminant analysis and Shoelace Theorem for area
  computation, alongside conceptual clarifications (e.g., tangency requires a double
  root). Conclusions derive specific results, such as p = 2 for a parabola focus-circle
  distance minimization.
