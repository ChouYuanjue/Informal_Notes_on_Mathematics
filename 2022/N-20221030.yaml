summary: This document outlines fundamental properties of integers, covering well-ordering,
  divisibility, greatest common divisors (g.c.d.), least common multiples (l.c.m.),
  and their relationship (dl=ab). It details the Division and Euclidean Algorithms
  for computing g.c.d., including an example, and notes that g.c.d. can be expressed
  as a linear combination. Primes and composites are defined, with the key property
  that primes dividing a product must divide one factor. The Fundamental Theorem of
  Arithmetic asserts unique prime factorization, and a formula for g.c.d. using prime
  exponents is provided. Finally, the Euler φ-function is introduced, defined as the
  count of numbers coprime to n, with formulas for prime powers and multiplicative
  properties, enabling computation via prime factorization.
