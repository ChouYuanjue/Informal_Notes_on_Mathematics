summary: This document presents informal notes on linear algebra, focusing on definitions
  and concepts. Key definitions include unit vectors, Kronecker delta (representing
  identity matrices), Einstein's summation convention, matrix rank, transpose, Hermitian
  conjugate, symmetric and skew-Hermitian matrices, trace, linear independence, spanning
  sets, basis vectors (including orthonormal and standard bases), and vector space
  dimension. It also details Gaussian elimination steps for solving linear systems,
  with corollaries on solution count (no solution, infinite solutions with arbitrary
  constants, or unique solution) and structure (general solution as sum of homogeneous
  solution and particular solution). The notes emphasize foundational linear algebra
  tools and their applications in solving equations.
