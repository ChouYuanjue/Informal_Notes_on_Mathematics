summary: 'This document presents informal notes on mathematical analysis, focusing
  on real numbers and metric spaces. Key points include: Lemma 3 establishes that
  for any positive real number, there exists a larger positive number and a smaller
  positive number, proven via ε-δ language. The text emphasizes a geometric perspective
  in analysis, visualizing real numbers as points on a line. Theorem 5 (Supremum Principle)
  states that every non-empty, bounded-above subset of real numbers has a least upper
  bound (supremum), proven using nested intervals and geometric reasoning, with dual
  results for infimum. The notes also introduce metric spaces, defining them as sets
  with a distance function satisfying non-negativity, symmetry, and the triangle inequality.
  Examples include Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and discrete metrics on various
  sets, along with subspace metrics and the concept of density in metric spaces. The
  interplay between axiomatic foundations (e.g., Archimedes'' axiom and nested interval
  principle) and geometric intuition is highlighted throughout.'
