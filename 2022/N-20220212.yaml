summary: This document provides an informal introduction to Riemann surfaces, defined
  as Hausdorff, second-countable, connected topological spaces with a complex structure,
  locally modeled on open subsets of ℂ. Key topics include definitions of Riemann
  surfaces and complex manifolds, examples such as open subsets of ℂ, the Riemann
  sphere, and complex tori, and mappings between Riemann surfaces emphasizing holomorphicity.
  Important results covered are the correspondence between meromorphic functions on
  a Riemann surface and holomorphic maps to the Riemann sphere, the constant degree
  of nonconstant holomorphic maps between compact Riemann surfaces, the equality of
  zeros and poles (counting multiplicities) for nonconstant meromorphic functions
  on compact Riemann surfaces, the Hurwitz formula relating genera and mapping degrees,
  and the identity theorem asserting that holomorphic maps agreeing on an open subset
  are identical everywhere. The text highlights the elegance and rigidity of the theory,
  particularly on compact surfaces.
