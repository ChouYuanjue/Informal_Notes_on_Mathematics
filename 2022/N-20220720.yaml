summary: This document presents informal notes on mathematics, focusing on combinatorial
  principles, calculus, and geometric proofs. Key topics include enumeration, addition
  and multiplication principles, inclusion-exclusion, permutations, combinations,
  binomial theorem applications, and derivative calculations. Examples cover counting
  problems, series expansions, inequalities, and geometric properties in 3D shapes.
  Findings include solutions to specific problems like counting non-multiples of 6
  or 8 up to 2021 (1517 numbers), expansion coefficients, and function comparisons.
  Conclusions emphasize methodical approaches to combinatorial and calculus problems,
  with proofs validating geometric relationships and derivative-based inequalities.
