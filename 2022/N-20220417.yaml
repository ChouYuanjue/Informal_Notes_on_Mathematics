summary: This document covers fundamental inequalities in mathematics, focusing on
  power means (including QM-AM-GM-HM relationships), Hölder's inequality, and inequalities
  involving functions such as convexity, Jensen's inequality, and Karamata's inequality.
  It provides proofs, examples (e.g., from Taiwan TST 2014), and techniques like Ravi
  substitution and Schur's inequality, concluding with applications and exercises
  linking these concepts to classical results like Cauchy-Schwarz and weighted means.
