summary: This document is a set of informal mathematics notes focusing on exercises
  related to functions, covering topics such as determining domains and ranges of
  various functions, proving properties like a+b=0 given specific conditions, analyzing
  the Dirichlet function's boundedness and periodicity, solving equations with constraints,
  evaluating function sums under given relations, and demonstrating that the maximum
  of two elementary functions is elementary. Key findings include specific domain
  intervals, range calculations, proofs of identities, and solutions to parameterized
  problems, concluding with techniques in function analysis and problem-solving strategies.
