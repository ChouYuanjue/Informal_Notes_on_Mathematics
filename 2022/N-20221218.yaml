summary: This document provides an introduction to metric spaces and basic topology,
  covering definitions and properties of boundedness, metrics, convergence, continuity,
  norms, inner products, and open/closed sets. Key topics include equivalent characterizations
  of boundedness, examples of various metrics (Euclidean, discrete, Manhattan, British
  railway, p-adic, uniform), proofs of uniqueness of limits and continuity criteria,
  and the relationships between norms, metrics, and inner products (including the
  Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). It also defines topological spaces, illustrates examples
  like discrete and finite complement topologies, and discusses bases and comparisons
  of topologies. The material connects analysis concepts to general metric and topological
  settings, emphasizing foundational definitions and properties.
