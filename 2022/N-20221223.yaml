summary: 'This document covers two main mathematical topics: homotopy theory in topology
  and algebraic structures in group theory. In homotopy, it introduces path homotopy
  as continuous deformation between paths with fixed endpoints, defines simply connected
  spaces where all paths are homotopic, and uses examples like C and C\{0} to illustrate
  these concepts. In algebra, it defines semigroups, monoids, and groups with their
  properties, provides propositions characterizing groups, and gives examples including
  integers under addition and symmetric groups. It also covers homomorphisms, defining
  various types (mono-, epi-, iso-, endo-, auto-morphisms) and their compositions,
  with examples like canonical epimorphisms from Z to Zm. The document concludes with
  a theorem on congruence relations forming quotient monoids/groups.'
