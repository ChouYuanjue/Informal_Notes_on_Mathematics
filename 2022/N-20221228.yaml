summary: This document presents informal mathematical notes focusing on quotient spaces
  and product topology within category theory and algebraic topology. Key concepts
  include defining quotient spaces through equivalence relations, such as identifying
  endpoints of an interval to form a circle (D¹/∼ ≈ S¹) or generalizing to Dⁿ/Sⁿ⁻¹
  = Sⁿ, and illustrating examples like cylinders and tori from square identifications.
  It also covers the product topology on Cartesian products (e.g., ℝ×ℝ as ℝ², S¹×S¹
  as a torus), with basis elements U×V for open sets U and V, and discusses nuances
  in notation and interpretations of quotient sets, highlighting potential ambiguities
  in mathematical conventions.
