summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes focusing
  on problem-solving examples from an Olympiad tutorial. Key examples include: determining
  maximum values of periodic functions using transformation properties (Example 1),
  finding minima of rational functions through algebraic manipulation (Example 2),
  analyzing logarithmic function transformations to compute maxima (Example 4), and
  solving cubic function symmetry problems to derive parameters and extremum values
  (Example 5). The final section proves an inequality for positive real numbers with
  product 1, demonstrating that the sum of reciprocal terms is at least 3/2 using
  algebraic inequalities and substitutions. Overall, the document illustrates advanced
  techniques in function analysis, optimization, and inequality proofs in mathematics.'
