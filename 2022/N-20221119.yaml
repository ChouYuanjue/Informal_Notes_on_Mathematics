summary: This document presents informal notes on number theory, focusing on prime
  and composite numbers. Key topics include definitions and properties of primes and
  composites, Euclid's proof of infinite primes, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the Fundamental
  Theorem of Arithmetic, divisor functions τ(n) and σ(n), perfect numbers, factorial
  prime factorization, and conditions for square numbers. It also covers modular arithmetic,
  Fermat's Little Theorem, and various proofs and examples, such as constructing prime
  tables, finding primes with specific forms (e.g., 4k-1), and demonstrating that
  the harmonic series is not an integer. The notes include solved problems on topics
  like coprime sums, consecutive composites, and divisibility conditions, concluding
  with exercises reinforcing these concepts.
