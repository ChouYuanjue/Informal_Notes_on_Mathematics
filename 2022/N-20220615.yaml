summary: 'This document presents the 2020 Vserossiyskaya Olimpiada po Elementarnoy
  Matematike (VOEM) early round, a Russian elementary mathematics competition. It
  includes instructions for participants, scoring details, and four mathematical problems:
  optimizing distances from points on a circle to fixed coordinates (Question 1),
  maximizing squared distances on a parabola over intervals (Question 2), solving
  circle packing problems for minimal bounding circle diameter and square side length
  (Question 3), and finding the smallest integer solution to a rational equation (Question
  4). The summary covers the test structure, rules, and key problem statements without
  solutions.'
