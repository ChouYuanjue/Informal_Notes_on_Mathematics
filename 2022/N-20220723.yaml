summary: This document explores the divisibility properties of polynomials related
  to roots of unity, focusing on conditions under which polynomials of the form \(x^{kn}
  + x^{(k-1)n} + \cdots + x^n + 1\) share a common factor \(P(x)\), such as \(x^2
  + x + 1\). Key findings indicate that \(x^{2n} + x^n + 1\) is divisible by \(x^2
  + x + 1\) if and only if \(n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), and generalizations show that
  for \(Q_{k,n}(x) = \sum_{i=0}^k x^{in}\), it shares a factor \(P_k(x)\) (the \(k\)th
  cyclotomic polynomial) precisely when \(\gcd(n, k+1) = 1\). The analysis leverages
  properties of roots of unity, complex exponentials, and factorization techniques,
  with proofs involving set equalities of roots and modular arithmetic conditions.
