summary: This document presents informal mathematical notes covering probability theory
  and algebraic substitutions. It begins by defining fundamental probability concepts
  such as random experiments, sample spaces, events, classical probability (with an
  example calculating the probability of keys not matching locks), geometric probability,
  conditional probability, and independence. The second part focuses on algebraic
  substitutions for solving inequalities under constraints like abc=1, introducing
  transformations such as x=a+1/a and deriving relations like x²+y²+z²−xyz=4. Applications
  include proving classical inequalities (e.g., Nesbitt's inequality) and solving
  problems involving acute triangles and polynomials, demonstrating that polynomials
  vanishing under specific substitutions must be divisible by x²+y²+z²−xyz−4. Key
  findings emphasize the utility of substitutions in simplifying and solving algebraic
  and probabilistic problems.
