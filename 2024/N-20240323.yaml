summary: This document presents informal notes on combinatorial mathematics, covering
  key topics such as combinatorial identities (including binomial theorem proofs),
  generating functions, Catalan numbers, convex sets, and graph theory. It explores
  problems involving "good sets" with specific size constraints, sequences satisfying
  binomial sum conditions, and applications of generating functions to counting problems.
  The text also discusses convexity properties, separation theorems for disjoint convex
  sets, and graph definitions including adjacency matrices, with a theorem proving
  that matrix powers count walks in graphs. The content emphasizes combinatorial proofs,
  recurrence relations, and algebraic methods in discrete mathematics.
