summary: This document provides a comprehensive overview of geometric transformations—affine,
  projective, inversion, Euclidean, and similarity—and their applications to conic
  sections, emphasizing invariants and classification. Affine transformations preserve
  collinearity and parallelism but not distances; projective geometry introduces points
  at infinity and cross-ratio invariance; inversion is conformal and maps circles
  to circles or lines. The discussion highlights connections to the Erlangen Program,
  illustrating how different geometries unify and classify conics through transformation
  groups and invariants.
