summary: 'This document provides informal notes on tensor mathematics, focusing on
  tensor representations in Cartesian bases, reciprocal bases, and component calculations.
  Key topics include: expressing tensors using dyadic bases in 2D and 3D; defining
  reciprocal basis vectors via matrix inversion and Kronecker delta; distinguishing
  roof (contravariant) and cellar (covariant) components; solving problems to compute
  reciprocal vectors and components; and introducing the permutation tensor Eijk for
  cross products, with properties based on Jacobian determinants and parity of index
  permutations. The notes emphasize practical computations and illustrate tensor operations
  in general bases.'
