summary: This document presents an overview of key theorems in Euclidean plane geometry,
  focusing on Ceva's theorem (used to prove concurrency of lines), Menelaus' theorem
  (for proving collinearity of points), Ptolemy's theorem and its generalization (relating
  sides and diagonals of cyclic quadrilaterals), Simson's theorem (on collinearity
  of perpendicular feet from a point on the circumcircle), and Euler's theorem (establishing
  collinearity of the circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter, along with Euler's
  formula R² - d² = 2Rr and the inequality R ≥ 2r). Each theorem includes proofs and
  discussions of their converses and applications.
