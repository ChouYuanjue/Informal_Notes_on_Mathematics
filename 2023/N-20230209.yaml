summary: This document provides an informal introduction to tensors, beginning with
  vector operations including a proof of the vector triple product identity and an
  example problem. It defines tensors as linear operators mapping vectors to vectors,
  introduces concepts such as direct products (dyads), transposes, symmetry properties,
  and Cartesian component representation using matrices. Examples include projection
  operators and the cross product tensor, illustrating how tensors can be expressed
  in matrix form. The notes emphasize foundational tensor properties and their mathematical
  representations, connecting abstract definitions to practical computations.
