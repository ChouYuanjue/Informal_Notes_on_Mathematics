summary: This document presents informal notes on combinatorics, covering fundamental
  concepts and methods. Key topics include permutations with repetition (n^r), arrangements
  of non-distinct elements (n!/(n₁!n₂!...nₖ!)), multiset combinations (grouping n
  distinct elements into k subsets), and combinations with repetition (C(n+r-1, r)),
  which is linked to non-negative integer solutions of equations like z₁+...+zₙ=r.
  It also discusses distance combinations (selecting r numbers from {1,...,n} with
  minimum gap m, resulting in C(n-(r-1)m, r)) and provides exercises involving combinatorial
  counts, proofs of identities (e.g., ∑jC(n,j)=n2^(n-1)), and practical applications
  such as coloring polyhedra and organizing sports pairings. The notes emphasize combinatorial
  principles, algebraic connections, and problem-solving techniques.
