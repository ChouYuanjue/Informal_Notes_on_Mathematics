summary: 'This document contains informal mathematical notes dated January 17, 2023,
  focusing on function exercises and set theory problems. Key findings include proofs
  for various function properties: non-negativity (f(x) ≥ 0 for all x), boundedness
  and continuity (|f(x₁) - f(x₂)| < 1/2 under certain conditions), evenness (f(-x)
  = f(x)), and specific values (e.g., f(1) = 1/3). It also explores integer-valued
  quadratic functions and solves problems involving logarithmic relationships (e.g.,
  b² = 9a, bc = 81) and set partitions with perfect squares. Conclusions demonstrate
  rigorous derivations of function behaviors and identities, though some sections
  note unresolved or challenging aspects.'
