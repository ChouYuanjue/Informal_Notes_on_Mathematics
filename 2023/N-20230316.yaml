summary: This document provides a comprehensive overview of fixed point theory and
  its applications across mathematics and computer science. It introduces the basic
  concept of fixed points, where a function maps a point to itself, and explains iterative
  methods for finding them. Key theorems covered include Banach's contraction mapping
  theorem, which guarantees unique fixed points under contraction conditions, along
  with extensions like Krasnoselskii, Meir-Keeler, and Geraghty theorems for non-contractive
  cases. It also discusses Brouwer and Schauder theorems in topology, Tarski's theorem
  in ordered sets, and applications in numerical methods (Picard iteration, Newton-Raphson),
  dynamical systems (stability analysis), and computer science (Y combinator, recursion).
  The document emphasizes the unifying idea that fixed points represent equilibrium
  or stable states across diverse fields, underpinning both theoretical proofs and
  practical algorithms.
