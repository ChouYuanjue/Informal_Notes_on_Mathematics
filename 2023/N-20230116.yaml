summary: 'This document presents supplementary exercises on mathematical functions,
  focusing on functional equations and combinatorial problems. Key solutions include:
  Exercise 2.2.9 determines the number of involutions \( f \) on \( \{1,2,...,10\}
  \) with \( |f(k)-k| \leq 2 \), concluding there are 401 such functions. Exercise
  2.2.10 solves \( f(x + f(x+y)) + f(xy) = x + f(x-y) + yf(x) \), finding only \(
  f(x)=x \) or \( f(x)=2-x \) satisfy the equation. Other exercises cover inequalities,
  function properties (e.g., monotonicity, symmetry), and conditions for integer outputs,
  with proofs and derivations provided for each. The document emphasizes analytical
  techniques and verification of solutions.'
