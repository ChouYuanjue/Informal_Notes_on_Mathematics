summary: This document provides an informal overview of nonstandard analysis (NSA),
  introduced by Abraham Robinson, which extends standard analysis by incorporating
  infinitesimals and infinite numbers through the hyperreal number system *R, constructed
  via ultrafilters and ultraproducts. Key concepts include the transfer principle,
  which ensures first-order logical statements hold in both standard and nonstandard
  systems, and definitions of continuity, derivatives, and integrals using infinitesimals
  for more intuitive proofs. NSA distinguishes internal and external sets and applies
  to probability via Loeb measures. While NSA offers intuitive and sometimes simpler
  proofs, it relies on model theory and set theory foundations, maintaining logical
  equivalence with standard analysis but with trade-offs in accessibility and application
  scope.
