summary: This document investigates gravitational fields, beginning with proofs that
  a uniform spherical shell exerts zero gravitational force on an interior point,
  using geometric and integral methods. It extends the analysis to non-spherical objects,
  deriving the gravitational potential and field for a uniform cuboid mass, showing
  deviations from spherical symmetry, such as stronger attraction at cube corners.
  Numerical simulations using the Runge-Kutta method demonstrate orbital dynamics
  around a cubic planet, revealing precession and distortion due to non-uniform gravitational
  fields. The conclusion emphasizes that only spherical masses can be treated as point
  masses, while others require integration methods, with Cartesian coordinates being
  more practical than spherical ones for non-spherical cases.
