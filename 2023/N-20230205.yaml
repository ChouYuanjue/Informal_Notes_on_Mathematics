summary: This document presents mathematical notes on functions and transformations,
  focusing on symmetry, periodicity, and graphical properties. Key findings include
  determining symmetry centers (e.g., (-2,3) for f(x)=x/(x+1)+(x+1)/(x+2)+(x+2)/(x+3)),
  solving for parameters like a=-4/3 to achieve center symmetry, and identifying maximum
  values (e.g., f(x) max=16 under x=-2 symmetry). It explores absolute value sets,
  zero counts (e.g., 6 zeros for h(x)=g(x)-f(x)), and functional equations, concluding
  with periodicity analysis (e.g., T=352 yielding 177 distinct values) and specific
  outputs like f(2019)=-1/2. The work emphasizes analytical techniques for function
  behavior and symmetry.
