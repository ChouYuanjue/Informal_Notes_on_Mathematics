summary: 'This document presents informal mathematical notes covering combinatorics,
  binomial identities, Helly''s theorem, and complex numbers. Key combinatorial problems
  include determining the maximum group size (n=7) for 14 students in overlapping
  research groups with constraints, solving equations with integer solutions (90 total
  solutions), and counting set pairs with equal sizes and union size 10 (5,167 cases).
  Binomial identities are proven: sums of jC(n,j) equal n2^(n-1), sums of jÂ²C(n,j)
  equal n(n+1)2^(n-2), and sums of squared binomial coefficients equal C(2n,n). Pairing
  arrangements for 2n players are derived, accounting for overcounting. Helly''s theorem
  for convex sets is explained with counterexamples for non-closed or unbounded sets.
  Complex number topics include modulus, an algebraic identity, and geometric interpretations
  in the complex plane.'
