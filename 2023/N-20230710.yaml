summary: 'This expository article by Runnel Cheung provides a comparative analysis
  of three foundational frameworks in mathematics: set theory, category theory, and
  type theory. Set theory, formalized through ZFC axioms, treats mathematical objects
  as sets and underpins classical mathematics. Category theory emphasizes morphisms
  and structural relationships, offering a unifying language across disciplines. Type
  theory, rooted in constructive and computational principles, connects logic and
  programming via the Curry-Howard correspondence. The paper examines historical origins,
  axiomatic structures, applications, and philosophical implications, concluding with
  modern developments like univalent foundations that aim to synthesize these approaches.'
