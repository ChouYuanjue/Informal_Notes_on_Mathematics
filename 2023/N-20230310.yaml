summary: 'This document provides an informal yet comprehensive overview of derivatives
  in mathematics, covering foundational concepts, rules, and applications. It defines
  derivatives geometrically as the slope of a tangent line and formally via limits,
  detailing differentiation rules including linearity, Leibniz (product), quotient,
  chain, and inverse function rules. It lists derivatives of elementary functions
  and discusses extrema, Fermat''s lemma, and methods for identifying local maxima/minima
  using first and second derivatives. The text applies derivatives to prove key inequalities:
  Young''s, Hölder''s, Minkowski''s, and Jensen''s inequality for convex functions,
  with examples and exercises illustrating these concepts. It concludes with practical
  problems involving function analysis, optimization, and comparisons, emphasizing
  the utility of derivatives in theoretical and applied contexts.'
