summary: This document presents informal mathematical notes focusing on trigonometric
  identities and matrix determinants. It begins by correcting a prior error in a trigonometric
  expression involving angles α and β, then explores solving a system of equations
  given sinα+sinβ=1/2 and cosα-cosβ=1/3 to find cosαcosβ, proposing two methods—one
  algebraic involving rational and irrational components, and another matrix-based
  approach that was incomplete. The notes also review multiple-angle formulas and
  recurrence relations for sin(nx), cos(nx), and tan(nx). Finally, it proves that
  the determinant of a specific tridiagonal n×n matrix with 2cosθ on the diagonal
  and 1s on the sub- and super-diagonals equals cos(nθ), using a recurrence relation
  and induction.
