summary: This document presents informal notes on mathematics, focusing on calculus
  and vector analysis. Key topics include derivatives of composite functions, integration
  concepts such as Riemann sums, definite and indefinite integrals, the Fundamental
  Theorem of Calculus, and the Newton-Leibniz formula. It provides worked examples
  applying these concepts to problems involving springs, chains, and motion, using
  techniques like separation of variables. The notes also cover differential equations,
  vector operations including dot and cross products, and physical applications such
  as torque, angular velocity, and gravitational forces. Conclusions emphasize practical
  problem-solving through integration, differentiation, and vector analysis, with
  examples illustrating mathematical derivations and physical interpretations.
