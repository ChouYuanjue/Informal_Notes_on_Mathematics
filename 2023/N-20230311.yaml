summary: This document compares Riemann and Lebesgue integration, highlighting their
  definitions, properties, and applications. Riemann integration relies on partitioning
  intervals and summing function values, but fails for functions with dense discontinuities
  (e.g., Dirichlet function). Lebesgue integration, based on measure theory, handles
  such functions by focusing on value distributions and supports powerful convergence
  theorems (monotone, dominated). It is more flexible for limits, infinite intervals,
  and applications in probability, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis, though
  Riemann remains intuitive for basic computations. The summary includes theoretical
  advantages, numerical considerations, and historical context.
