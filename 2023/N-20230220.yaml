summary: This document presents informal mathematical explorations into alternative
  proofs of trigonometric sum and difference angle formulas, focusing on sine, cosine,
  and tangent. It begins with a cross product method for proving the sine difference
  formula, then discusses rotation matrices and Euler's formula for deriving sine
  and cosine formulas. The author expresses interest in directly proving the tangent
  sum formula and attempts using reciprocal basis vectors, achieving a derivation
  for the tangent difference formula through matrix operations and geometric interpretations.
  A projection vector approach is also attempted but deemed unsuccessful, reverting
  to basic trigonometric ratios. The key findings include successful derivations using
  cross products, rotation matrices, Euler's formula, and reciprocal basis methods,
  while highlighting challenges in directly proving the tangent sum formula with vector-based
  techniques.
