summary: This document provides an informal overview of group actions, homotopy theory,
  and the Hopf fibration. It begins by defining group actions, illustrating concepts
  such as stabilizers and orbits, and citing Cayley's theorem. It then introduces
  homotopy, cofibrations, and fibrations, explaining their roles in algebraic topology
  for classifying spaces and continuous maps. The discussion covers spheres and homotopy
  groups, including definitions and structural properties. Finally, it describes the
  Hopf fibration as a map from S³ to S², constructed via complex ratios or quaternion
  rotations, and provides references for further exploration. The notes emphasize
  foundational concepts with examples and intuitive explanations, acknowledging potential
  inaccuracies and recommending external resources.
