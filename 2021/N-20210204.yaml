summary: This document presents foundational concepts in set theory and functions,
  covering definitions of sets, proper classes (illustrated by Russell's Paradox),
  power sets, indexed families with unions and intersections, and relative complements.
  It details properties of sets including DeMorgan's Laws, defines functions with
  images and inverse images, and characterizes injective, surjective, and bijective
  functions. Key theorems establish relationships between function composition and
  injectivity/surjectivity, and Theorem 1.0.10 shows that a bijective function has
  a two-sided inverse, contingent on the Axiom of Choice. The content serves as an
  introductory framework for mathematical structures and mappings.
