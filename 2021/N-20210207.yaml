summary: This document covers foundational concepts in set theory, including the Axiom
  of Choice and its equivalence to the existence of choice functions, definitions
  of partially and totally ordered sets, Zorn's Lemma, and the Well Ordering Principle.
  It introduces cardinal numbers, equipollence, and finite/infinite sets, proving
  key results such as Cantor's theorem (|A| < |P(A)|), the Schröder-Bernstein theorem,
  trichotomy for cardinals, and properties of infinite sets (e.g., every infinite
  set has a denumerable subset, and for infinite cardinals α and β with β ≤ α, α +
  β = α and αβ = α). It concludes with corollaries on the cardinality of finite subsets
  of infinite sets.
